B07NY53YR8,R3PRFK1OTZS2QF,Can't beat this deal!,"Liked the ability to charge two phones while driving using the power outlet in my car. This, and the home charger with cable, are an added treat. Good quality and provides quick charging whether at home or in the car.",5
B077XQJ2FK,R2H5O5LZ0FI3B7,Great value. Works great,Better than I expected for the price well made and fast charging.,5
B084V4KHM1,R3JFZ539CX1QSM,Great Stand,"Works great for iPhone/AirPods/Apple Watch -- it does fold flat so you have to be careful with the kickstand coming out, but otherwise works quite well.",5
B09GTW6591,R1AIYXPOYT3DU9,Garbage,"I bought a 3 pack because I needed 2 and this was the cheapest way to do it. Unfortunately right out of the box one didn't work at all but I expected that from a cheap Amazon product. The reason for 1 star is because after a few weeks one of them stopped working through the USB A and the other stopped working through the USB C, both needed to work through both ports so now they're all in the garbage.",1
B07XJTT9WG,R3EFSRYJZ50SD6,Its fast charging.,Its great charged fast,5
B08FBDWZWR,R1F6YES24MQA50,Does work with Samsung watch,"I have a Samsung 3 frontier watch with oem band, no matter how I placed it, it would not complete a charge.",2
B07FBCYGFV,R27DJM3EP52JGG,Works well.,I use it for my multiple charging station and it works great.,5
B088D4CNHV,R3UJNGZXHQM0YP,Do not buy.,Horrid. Avoid at all costs. The chargers only last about 30 days before crapping out. I've gone through 4 in less than 6 months.,1
B07X32ZLM5,R1O5XWWXRDK1GM,"Works great, a little small for large phones","The charger works great on my note 10+, but it seems a little small. The phone has a case on it made by SUPCASE (unicorn beetle pro). The small ledge makes the phone a little wobbly to place on the charger with the case. Outside the case it is not so bad. The charger has no issues with plastic and rubber cases, Iphone 8 with a tpu shell, note9 with an otterbox defender, and a note10+ with the supcase all had no issues charging. The charger comes with its own usb A-C cable and a multi-voltage wall plug. The Usb cable is quite short. Build quality is quite nice. The charger has a little fan inside of it that is supposed to cool the charger and phones backplate. I dont notice any difference in phones warmth after charging. The fan is super quiet, but sounds really cheap. Mine makes odd noises, like plastic or something rubbing. Charges nice and fast tho. The charger has a nice finish and sturdy feeling build. The backplate the phone rests on is smooth-like, and not padded. The indicator light is too minimal for my taste.

TL;DR
Pro
Nice and sturdy, works very well.
Looks quite nice and simple

Cons
Dubious fan.
A little small for larger phones.

For the price it is a nice charger tho.",4

B00846FO0I,R9PVEL5LR5FEP,right idea not worth the price.,Absolute rip off. Paid at least 3x more than I should have. I don’t care if this is a hot item. This is not worth $25.00.,1
B08JFTNJQX,R9SWN4GMU80X8,Perfect for apple,This charging station is exactly what we needed. No more cords all over the nightstand. Handles all three apple devices perfectly. Love being able to use my phone as a clock now in the upright position.,5
B08D34L2F8,R1XLESZPOJPJHS,Muy mala experiencia,"Muy mala experiencia, me permite cargar mi Apple Watch y AirPods Pro, pero cuando intento cargar mi iPhone 12 Pro Max con funda simplemente no carga, cuando otros cargadores inalámbricos con la misma funda si pueden cargarse.",2
B07L15S1DD,R2VJ5IHZDFSGGO,Mom loves it!,"Recently her phones charging port broke and was worried she would have to replace her phone.

B09GF1YXHY,ROM82VL78TIJ5,Works great,Enough said,5
B09JZZVSFF,R1I57291D5CON4,Best charger I've ever owned. Hands down fastest highest quality charger for Samsung.,By far the fastest charger I've ever had. Very sturdy durable charger. It can charge my Note 10 from 5% to 100% in about 45-50 mins sometimes quicker. Its a little pricey for a charger but overall the power and quality make it well worth the price tag.,5
B09FKZ7M9M,R289Y9EFFF9MNP,Wireless charger,"This works as described. It can be tricky to get it on just right to charge, but no big deal. Charges my phone like it should.",4

B07PGT7LSR,R3SIRJNC9BDBYU,"Great quality, low profile",I like most items from Anker. This charger is great looking and low profile. Much better than others I have tried.,5
B08L6LZQLK,R30Z41XG3M181D,Pretty Great!,Pretty great. My wife uses this every night for the past 3 months. No issues so far. Not Magsafe But pretty decent wireless charging.,5
B07VSMK849,R1BSF9Q87KA66W,"Unusual failure, but really great customer and warranty support!","At the outset, let me make clear that I'm an Anker fan. I've bought and still have probably two or three dozen Anker power devices of all kinds over the years. My Atom PD4 has been excellent for almost a year. So I was really surprised when it failed - I've never had a failure on any of my purchases. So I contacted Anker via their online support website.

They came back with the typical suggestions (I'm a geek and had already tested different cables, different outlets, shook it three times to the left, and the right). Reported the negative results back to them, and within a few days I got a replacement, which was new (not a refurb), and works perfectly. And they didn't even ask me to return the defective one whoch would have been a hassle - they instructed me to throw it away. Still impressed by Anker, and super impressed by their customer service, which makes me even more comfortable sticking with Anker in future.

So the 5 stars are a combination of their long term reliability except for this single event, and their customer service.",5
B089G6RM6Z,R2VY9J2N3ENOZT,Stopped working after 3 months,"I bought 1 at first and it still works great so I bought a second one for my wife and after the return period ended it would no longer charge either of our phones. Instead it drains them no matter how many times we rest the unit or our phones. Pretty disappointed that it’s a 50/50 shot it’s going to work or not. Now I can’t return the defective unit nor does Amazon give me a way to contact the seller of the unit for a replacement.

EDITED on 9/8/21
Seller reached out an offered a full replacement unit which has been ordered. Once the new unit arrives and is tested I will edit this review again. I added 1 extra star so far due to the prompt response and credited unit I will be receiving.",3
B09LCTMGF9,RJY05UP91NRM1,excellent product for the price.,"product worked for Iphone 8, XS Max, 11 pro, 12 pro, and 13 and 13 pro. I like the feature that allows you to charge all three gadgets on charger without plugging in more wires.",5
B0773BYS6P,R3H72FSR3RRLDC,Works well,I checked accuracy with my volt/ohm meter and it is right on!,5
B07L9QST54,RCIQ5KTDJBBT1,Could use longer wiring but overall good product!,"I installed this into my 2015 Nissan Pathfinder for the middle row.
I spliced it with one of the existing adapters.

The wiring could have been 6"" longer but I made it work.

The charger works like a charm!",4
B00VH8ZW02,RW9P031GHFMK1,This USB charger has ended the charging cord tangle,This USB charger has ended the charging cord tangle for me. It has plenty of charging ports and uses just one section of the wall power outlet! No more multiple chargers vying for wall outlet space. Very happy with this small footprint charger,5

B00P933OJC,RSTDLI7KLWEGQ,This replaces all of my OEM chargers!!,"Works great to charge multiple devices faster than any single charger I have used in the past. I also have a couple other 6 port 60 Watt chargers that seem to work equally well. This Anker charger is a bit heavier (and more expensive) than my other 6 port chargers. I can't be sure there is any quality difference, but the overall ""finish"" and the heavier weight give me the impression this is a higher quality product.
When my wife and I travel, this one 6 port charger takes care of all of our devices and definitely charges multiple devices quickly without getting too warm. I really have no use for the chargers that were provided when I purchased my devices and now I no longer have to keep track of multiple chargers.",5
B071FG7PPL,RMOFJFE18RGDR,Good,Good deal. Says it’s fireproof but I’ve only used it a couple of time. Hopefully it’s true.,5

B06XXZK99F,R32YU1Q1V5GBYV,Note no plug in,"Just received this—it works great so far, charges quickly. The only thing I didn’t realize when purchasing is that it doesn’t come with the plug in piece, so you need an AC/usb adapter.",5

B08S3JYG32,R2CJT5RQ34IZLE,Excellent,Love them. Great buy,5
B07MPRKZ74,R3IJJDIU3OIOJS,The USB-C connection is no good,"I bought these as a cheap alternative to the official Samsung charger. Cheap is the important word. Both of the included USB to USB-C cables were loose on the USB-C side and not detected by my phone unless I held them at an angle that felt like it could do permanent damage to my charging port. I'm not sure if the charging bases (the AC adapter) are any good, but the included cables are garbage. I'd return, but at this low of a price, it just isn't worth my time to bother. I guess them being so cheap I don't care about a refund might be a selling point for some, so there's that.",1
B07XLG8H2D,RHRWE5LIHAYTX,Great idea,"I love this charging station. I have all my devices in one place and it doesn’t take up
a lot of room on the night stand. Highly recommend",5

B07JWF6X2C,R16ED4RH6MSVHS,Extra Phone Charger,Charger works perfectly. I like the idea of the bright blue cord and trim which allows you to easily recognize it if you're moving it from one vehicle to another.,5
B0992F2D7X,R3OVKLU02L00CB,Super convenient charger,I like that it was flat and not very large and charged both watch and phone at the same time. Had it for a while now and works perfectly.,5
B00VH88CJ0,RI6V96723X89J,they shipped new updated ones with a much better tip spring strength so they stay engaged in the ...,"Charges fast, especially when paired with one of Anker's PowerLine cables. Tiny blue LED is bright enough to be seen in the daylight, but not too overpowering at night in my opinion. I bought 3 of these in September 2015 and they had the issue of the tip spring being far too strong, as one prominent reviewer Jason S noted. The tip spring was so strong it would push the charger back out of the lighter socket over a few days of driving. This happened in more than one vehicle. After putting up with this for 4 months, I contacted Anker service, they shipped new updated ones with a much better tip spring strength so they stay engaged in the lighter. Glad they made this change to fix this flaw on an otherwise excellent car charger because the internal electrical component quality is good. Kudos to Anker for standing behind their product.",5
B07WC2FQ65,R2EKXBIQA2PLP5,Useless,"Couldn't keep phone centered to charge- would get it in place and then without touching it, it would quit",1

B078LS9DY1,RBW1A6DD3LNZB,Very nice product.,"Great product. No complaints. Isn’t as fast as some of my plug in chargers, but faster than others. However, if you add into the equation the time you save by just placing it on the pad, it’s as fast, or faster than any plug in charger. And extremely more convenient.
I’m ordering several for Christmas presents and more for myself.
I highly recommend this product.",5
B09JP4FSY2,RPQC332EHG8KU,Good purchase !,Good quality charger for a good price. Charges my phone very fast. Faster than any other charger.,5

B07KP49H6C,R3KKM9649MGO0Z,Excellent Phone Car Charger,This car phone charger is very durable & works very well to keep my phone's GPS working even on long trips. The cord length is more than adequate to go from the plug-in point to the phone holder on my windshield. It is also very sturdy to keep in my car despite the year-round FL heat. It doesn't crack from sun exposure like my previous car charger.,5
B07RHSD9WM,R2GOVQVVTTFUSU,Not as powerful as claimed,"Not as powerful as claimed. When using both ports at the same time, I got 5 watts out of the USB-C port. When only using the USB-C port, I was able to get 8 watts. Was expecting to get 18 watts as claimed. Tested using iPhone XS.",2

B088RDWBBL,RLIXOOV7F5LGW,Great at first but fire hazard.,This product was amazing at first I had for 3 months not an issue. Charged everything fine and was exactly what I was looking for.

B07GWQ2GJC,R1T9LTNJOY75TO,Not satisfied,"Every-time I need to unplug the cable from the adapter to make it charging and Sometimes it reaches 60% or 80% charged, then it stops charging, and I need to unplug the cable to make it work again. It makes me angry.",1
B09N982NDT,R1YBR0X3S6VTLY,Overall a good charger,The charger is light weight and as described. Works good,5
B07ZCCVL5Q,R2BEO2C6U0BZNH,Does the job,My old lay down charger was hit and miss with charging my iPhone 13 because of the case I had. I have not had one night where my phone hasn’t charged with this unit. I like that I can turn the light on the charger on or off. I also hang my watch on this charger as well. All with one cord that came with it. No plugging in extra charger cords here. Looks sleek too. I have not taken it with me on travel so I couldn’t give it any stars there.,4
B0798X8Y9K,R2SH5L1UGRZWU2,I just became a Alpatronix Raving Fan,This is my third order from Alpatronix. I am absolutely pleased with everything I ordered from them. Everything works like it should! The 2-year extended warranty is great. The process for the warranty is simple and fast. I gave Alpatronix two thumbs up!,5
B072K6BLJJ,R2ILPWGZ3P56IR,Terrible charger for LG V10,I bought this charger to use with my LG V10 and it is awful. I thought that it would be a fast charger for my phone but it is not. I have only got it to say fast charging once after pluging it in over and over. Most times a message comes up on my phone and says charging slowly and to change to the original charger. I have to keep checking on it to see if it is indeed charging or not. Would not recommend.,1
B09PGBDP66,R2JFU35DV7XRHS,Worth the price,This product was priced very well and the items work really good. I love the fact that I got 3 chargers for the price I would normally pay for one. I will definitely reorder again.,5
B01N68AMCU,R3OCONWVBFMID4,I wouldn't buy again.,Everything works great with these chargers except for the fact that it gets hot to the touch when plugged in. I can't in good conscience continue to use them. They can't be trusted to be left plugged in with that happening. It has happened in every outlet I tried them in both in my house and our toy hauler when camping.,1

B07P54F2JH,R2JVSCIIUV1WGT,ALMOST BURNT THE HOUSE DOWN!,"I bought this charger for myself about a year ago and thought it was great, so I bought my girlfriend one. A few weeks later she put her phone on as we were going to bed and we were woken up by the smell of smoke a few minutes later. The charger port and the cord end had completely melted together and broken off. I’m so glad we woke up and caught it before it got worse, I can’t imagine if the bed sheets had caught fire! I really liked my first charger but with this happening I can’t bring myself to trust any of their products anymore",1

B07437M5QQ,R1V8C4URVX5KA2,Simple chargers,These feel pretty cheap and they are super light weight. I only use these to charge my iphone. They also never seem to get as hot as the original iphone wall charger did. They get the job done just fine.,4

B09KZMN957,R3W4ASKQRAVLC9,Ne Fonctionne plus après seulement trois mois,"Produit reçu rapidement de ce côté là pas de soucis, la recharge du téléphone semble correcte, par contre le puissant aimant censé maintenir le chargeur collé au téléphone, là ça ne fonctionne pas. L'aimant doit empêcher le téléphone de glisser, de pouvoir utiliser le téléphone pendant qu'il recharge, comme le montre une image dans la description du produit, mais malheureusement en vrai ce n'est pas le cas, le téléphone glisse et risque de tomber, ce qui lui vaut mes deux étoiles ! je fais une demande de remplacement (merci Amazon) en espérant que ce soit juste mon produit qui est défectueux. Réponse dans quelques jours...
12/06/21 : remplacement rapide (merci Amazon) mais après seulement trois mois d’utilisation le chargeur ne fonctionne plus. Lorsque je met mon iPhone sur le chargeur, j’ai bien le petit éclair qui s’affiche dans batterie en haut à droite mais le téléphone ne charge pas. Après 4h de charge, ma batterie n’a pas grimpé d’un seul pourcent. Testé avec mon iPhone 12 Pro Max et l’iPhone SE deuxième génération de ma femme, avec le même résultat. En apparence le téléphone charge mais en apparence seulement. Je suis extrêmement déçu par ce produit.",1

B077HFFLMS,RDP61ZE9UGTCW,Fair review for a great product,"This charger comes with a quick charge 3.0 feature, but please note, this feature doesn't work on all devices, including iOS products (iPhone, iPad). Some reviewer gave this product a one star review, simply because it didn't charge their iPhone quick enough, it's not fair. Although, the quick charge 3.0 doesn't work on iPads, but it still charger a bit faster than the Apple OEM iPad charger (Apple 5.03V x 1.87A VS. Anker 5.16V x 2.15A).",5
B01K9MQ8WW,R3VATMTAY742MR,Very reliable!,"When the package first arrived, it actually came in a nice little box. Opened it up and I love the material of the product, the carbon fiber texture adds a nice modern look. When I plugged it in, my phone actually charged much faster than normally, cannot complain, it’s very convenient and I recommend it.",5
B09KTZ4LX7,R1CSUYND817I9A,All in one,Perfect all in one charger. I would always forget my Apple Watch because I had to charge it somewhere else besides my night stand. Now it’s right with my phone.,5
B01LY6JEBQ,R1UC7LWWVLG3KV,Possibly defective,The display was excellent. I have had a few of these usb volt meters where the display was too weak to see. Unfortunately the voltmeter was broken. It would oscillate between 12.2 volts and the actual voltage of 14.1. I was so disappointed I returned it. If they can get their quality improved it would get 5 starts.,1
B07XLG8H2D,RIZQG5EU1E9AO,Great Charger,Product works as stated. Love that it only requires 1 usb connection (old 1 had 2). The best part is the induction charging is strong. Was having problems charging with the case I have. Not with this one. Works perfectly.,5

B08FBFJDQ1,R3735CDOJRRK96,Is not clear white.Is more like grey+white (Dirty white) !,"I though it would be more like smooth premium surface touch feeling but its just medium cheap plastic.

It has decent weight.

I bought it as white colour and advertised as it is but when in real life is more like dirty white. Grey + white. IS NOT TOTALLY WHITE. I think black one has little better colour finish.l than this one.

I dont have a smartwatch so i cant test if it works but it should.

It charges fine because most people dont understand this is more of a night charging pad where you dont need super ultra fast charging.Your sleeping for 8 hours.",3
B08CXZQ1N1,R1MCZ5C7JJYFCV,Best Charging Station,"My wife and I love this product. It is very useful. It includes iphone, iPad, iwatch, AirPod chargin station. Normally I bought just one. Then my wife likes it so much. She took it for herself. So I bought it again for me.",5

1. no overheating with 2 max Iphones in the charger at the same time.

B08J49THFB,RT9RXU263HUNA,Not bad at all,"Easy to place your phone as it seems it has a decent range and thus, you don't need to be too precise about putting your phone on the center. Quick charges my phone but I think it might depend on the phone's capability for fast charge as well. No complaints thus far and I've had it for about 6-months so I'm thinking about buying another one. Overall 4.8 Star rating!",5

B08YYMCK26,R3SOHGIY75JH85,Decent speed and heat under control,"More expensive than others but worth the price given the charging speed and that it doesn't get hot.

Pros:
- it charges about 45% of iPhone12 total capacity in 1hr
- it does get warm but not dangerously hot like many others
- stand is actually quite usefull and it helps dispersing the heat
- detachable cable that helps when traveling as you don't need another type-c cable that helps with clutter and packing

Cons:
- more expensive",5

I'm surprised Apple hasn't done this themselves, but thank you Anker for filling that need. This dual USB-C charger is great and I havent had any issues fast charging or charging in general. I use it to juice up my iPhone and Apple Watch and there's never a worry. Can take me from dire levels of red to at least an 85% full battery in 30. Great buy! Great brand, if you're on the fence, just do it!",5

I'm getting fast charge on both ports, though I haven't tried both at the same time yet. I liked that it came with plenty of wire to meet my car's wiring harness. I did have to cut off the connectors, but that's Chevy's fault. Overall, go for it if your stock lighter port sucks or you want dedicated USB fast charging ports!",5

B08J49THFB,RXG8EZUHBDMUR,Buy and use with a 2A power adapter,"Update: this charger is fantastic. The trick is, you need to use a 2A power adapter. If you use a 1A adapter, the connection will be shotty and might not reach through your case. I emailed customer service to discover this. They were fantastic and helped me realize my problem quickly. I am going to leave this review at 2 stars so people will read it. Moral of the story: Buy this and get a 2A power adapter for it.

Old review: This charger looks fantastic. The problem is, it struggles..... If you have any type of case on your phone, even a thin one, the charger won't work. If your phone is bumped out of position, the charger won't work. It is extremely finicky. It is really annoying to wake up in the morning and discover that the phone you carefully placed and adjusted the night before, never charged. (My phone case is very simple and extremely thin. My wife's phone has the same issues on this charger)
I have (tried to) use this product every night for the past two months. I am going to go buy something else now.",2
B09K71GBYQ,R5FXGA45LEATF,Doesn't charge full and cannot get two phones to charge on it,"Unfortunately, this product is meh. My wife bought it so we could use the magnetic part of charging, but it just does not work. I like efficiency and I could not find a sweet spot for both phones to charge at once. On top of that, even when I lay my own phone on it, it does not get a full charge after 6 hours. It is...meh.",3
B09L824FJL,RS7X7NRTFK4GL,Chargers fast,Okay so I'm a very satisfied it works .and it's pretty fast it's faster then the normal way and easy to use .I also have a thicker case on my phone and it doesn't interfere with charging .time will tell I just received it today I want to thank the seller for fast shipping I order on Jan 17 and got it Jan 22 I would had gotten it a day sooner but it was a holiday so it got held back ..the whole process was amazing,5

B0743MXCJB,R1ITA2NA57S8DK,Five Stars,Arrived early and works great! Very happy with purchase!,5
B00P933OJC,R19AQ5VSKYMXE5,Must have if you have multiple devices (and who doesn't at this point),"Being a tech junkie means there are always devices in the house that need to be topped off with a charge. The problem, before picking up the Anker PowerPort 6 was that it meant having to juggle cables and rationing outlets. Loosing 1 plug to each device being charged is very problematic, especially when outlets are generally sparse in older construction. The PowerPort solves all those problems by allowing me to charge up to 6 devices at once while only using 1 plug into the outlet/power strip. Charging 2 iPhones, a Kindle, iPod, and iPad is no problem. Having a centralized point of charging is also very handy as you no longer have to leave devices strewn about the house. Now you can create a happy little charging area for easy retrieval.

I loved my first PowerPort so much that I picked up a second for my office. Leaving it plugged in and having my cables within easy reach means I can top off any device that may need it without rummaging about for a wall charger or crawling under the desk to switch out charging cables.",5
B07CHZ8S29,R1BW5Y2WV2C2CB,Wrong cord,Have lg g4 phone cord said it fits that phone but prong dose not to small wasted money for item that doesn't fit,2

B081Z8413L,R20TDIGJUVTJ3M,Great charger,"I like it. It definitely saves space as far as cords go. My only gripe is that the smaller charger section that you would use to charge a watch is not magnetic so the watch slides around very easily. Other than that It charges my phone, watch, and wireless earphones great. Charging all 3 still fast charges simultaneously",4

B07NPD5T5H,R1VMKL8DUKTOBX,These aren't as fast as the ad says,I've used these for a couple of weeks & disagree with the ad about the speed of charging. I think they deserve 4 stars because they aren't as fast as the ad says & yet they DO work efficiently.,4
B07HPVW9TN,R1D45SPU51CEIZ,How COOL,"How cool is this charger!! It absolutely charges through a case . This is an iPhone 8 plus with a case sitting inside the frame and charging. What a great invention, super happy I picked this up! Comes in a gorgeous box too, would make a really nice gift for graduation, small wedding or birthday. I am super excited about this one, we are a gadget and tech family, and this is a welcome addition for sure!",5

B082X6N8PD,R1FM8MER0WD1WJ,Garbage! Do not buy!,"This thing is absolute garbage. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my wife. We have very thin cases on our phones and out of 5 days of charging, it fails to charge our phones at least 3 of those days. We decided to take the cases off of our phones while we charge, and it’s the same. At least 3-4 nights per week it fails to charge. The LEDs turn on randomly on both units, and it the quality isn’t great.",1
B01JLXTQ1U,R16K6XCZ6CMK30,Three years and still working!,"While shopping for stocking stuffers, I just saw that I purchased one of these in Dec 2016 — 3 years ago — and I still use my wall charger daily with no issues. It’s so rare to find electronic cables and charges that have that long of life span, that I felt I had to leave a review. It’s definitely been a worthwhile purchase for me anyway.",5

B07H2YNPVP,R1B2WA0441D6OI,Fast charging of my IPhone SE 2020 is Great!,This charger quickly charges my IPhone SE 2020. Two seconds to set up. I like the way it lights up to indicate phone is charging but then dims the lights but continues to charge.,5

B078LS9DY1,RZ7215GPGVQFJ,Super easy to use,"You just set the phone on top of the charger, the green light changes to blue to let you know that it's charging. Nothing could be easier. I always hated when I'd pick up my phone and find out the next morning that it hadn't charged. When the light turns green, it's charged. The light is bright enough to find in the dark, but not bright enough to keep you awake or even be aware of at night. Very sleek, nice looking on your nightstand.",5

B07FBF2BNT,RWB2GL18H91HX,Did Not Work for Long -- Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this three way charger back in January and by the end of April the charger just stopped working. Of course I changed the plugs the charger was plugged into and also the cables I has plugged into the charger.
With only a month to return (which would have been in February and this is May) I now have a useless charger.",1
B087BY5HLB,R543A3H3XPQY8,nice to have,"this product is nice to have less cord. I am kinda disappointed that I cant have any case on my nphone in ordr for it to charge, since it can be a pain to remove just to charge. it is very nice for the apple watch, and doesn't work to charge regular air pods. they must be the pro or aapple 2. other then that its nice and in great shape. comes with an extened 2 year warrenty that must be field out with in 7 days. but in order to get this warrenty you must right a rreveiw. and doesn't have an option if you paid with debit for discount. bt other then that im happy with it",3
B09M3MP2LB,R3I23EUCJ8TNP5,Best multi-charger I’ve ever used,"I had a charging station previously that would charge my phone and my watch, but it required 2 cables, one for each device. This only requires one and makes it so easy to keep watch, phone, and earbuds charged. After initial setup there isn’t anything to plug in. Just place your devices in their correct position on the charger and wake up to fully charged devices without a tangled mess of cords. Highly recommend this charging station!",5
B07THTWP1N,RGVLU4O9A3SDR,Works like my original,Works just like original charger that came with my Samsung phone,5

B086SM2KWH,RUVNQ66BC6ZJH,Good product! I bought two of them.,"This wirelessly charger came with a great package box and looks beautiful. I love the wireless charging function it provides, so that I can charge my iPhone 11 and watch tv series the same time without concerning about battery’s falling.",5
B086WDHCVV,R3L70OK9LG8M4D,Stay away,Will not be using and do not recommend. Looks great !! The watch charger overheats watch and watch shuts down when it reaches 80%. For the phone charger it takes a lot of effort to find the sweet spot to charge. You can not just lay your phone down. More then likely will not find the charging area. I do not recommend,1
B07V4DB1Q8,R2JQ9H7N179PPN,Stopped charging after 6 months,I really liked this charger at first but recently when I put my phone on the charger it randomly stops charging after a few minutes. I'm constantly waking up to a dead or near dead phone. I always make sure my phone chimes saying it's charging and it doesn't move all night. When I check the battery charging monitor on my phone it says it only charged for 36 minutes. Wish I could get my money back or a replacement.,2
B082V54Z7M,R3L76KV9Y2JQ8J,Fantastic,This is a great charging station for Apple products. It does require a 20 watt power source for the fastest charge rate of all three at once.,5

B07S5B2YRM,RKHYG3E2E0Q3,Good product in cheap price,I bought this as I lost my original charging cable. It came with both plugged and car charger which is what i needed.

B07DMNPNSH,R1BE4IAWCEOJIC,Great charging station!,We ordered this unit so that my wife and I and our two boys could keep all of our phones and iPads charged in one place. It's small and works perfectly for our needs. Great Value for the money!,5

B0836QVLD3,RZLOVAFQ5BE9T,Works fine but not FAST,"The product works fine, like you would expect of a charger. But the work FAST in the product description is a bit misleading. I am using this to charge iPhone Xs and iPad Pro and the charging duration is similar to the charge that comes as OME.",4

The rest are all, 1x2 amp, then 1x1 amp slots. I charge two go pros, various power banks, and other camera lights all at once quickly. Great value for the money.",5
B07VQ8GS26,R1RNB6ET3WHAXH,I like this Charger-5-Stars,Spent a lot of time researching Chargers and narrowed to this charger. Bought three of these. Seems like you always need extra. I like the fact the charge has dual ports and the front has a light on top. Also this charge has a life time replacement warranty. I would order again. I have three vehicles and use them a lot . Never a problem. Also well packed in a nice cardboard box with foam padding. Impressed.,5
B0771HWYH9,R28PICWAWPT67H,Works like a charm.,Plugs in good and tight and charges fast.,5
B09HZBN2MJ,R31CD4DLOQTMS6,Works ok…. when it wants to,"I’ve had this for a few weeks now and it’s extremely temperamental. Sometimes it will work perfectly and other times it won’t even work at all. For instance, I’ll place my watch on the charger and it won’t recognize that it’s there. The same thing with my phone. If I don’t place it on at just the right angle it won’t charge. I am returning it because I’m sick of going some nights without a charge.",2
B09DKHWYKZ,R1S45QWQJIIDLR,Powerful,"Needed a wireless charger for my office and this works perfectly. I keep my phone charged and when I’m not on calls I can put my air pods on it.

B09MF22DQG,R3EPT9PRG4UUYD,Access with caution,"Although this is such a great accessible tool it has its flaws. One it's not for people with small children only because of the flexible stand. Other than that, I would total give it an thumbs up",3
B07VP3HLGW,R10W7FHHB5AXDA,Fast charging for a cheap price,"I own a Samsung Galaxy S21, and charges it pretty damn fast for how cheap it is. Only thing I'd have to say is that the build quality is kinda lacking, but again it's relatively cheap and is coming from a respectable brand. Would recommend!",4

B07RHSD9WM,R2JTM4GW2LPTTM,Pops out of socket,"I was super excited to finally get a USB-C charger for car, as I am always in it for work and as my phone is aging it loses battery quite fast. This charger works really well and charges fast - when it is fully seated in the outlet. However, I realized it comes loose on its own and I have to keep making sure it is still plugged in. The cord itself is great, but I feel like I will have to replace the car charger piece. My car is a 2015 subaru impreza just fyi.",3
B09LXPZ57Q,R2T5HJ8VWT50TE,Works,"This USB/C charger is a great addition to any car! It is simple to use and the instructions are pretty straight forward. This came with a C to C cable that is much thicker than your standard cable, unfortunately it didn't seem to work for me, but plugging in a C to C I already had (and the reason I got this charger) worked! When the car is not on, there are no lights, the light is white when the car is on but not in use, green when it is in use, but using a lower voltage charger, and supposedly orange when using the fast charging that I was not able to see due to not having the correct cable.

It works, it does what I need it to! I'm happy!",4
B071YMZ4LD,R1UOCSFO0GY9TW,Doubles and a nightlight...,"I understand WHY they might do this, say daylight conditions, but it's slightly bothersome for someone who likes to keep a super dark bedroom or something. It's worked well enough so far but It did seem to overheat and throttle itself off QC mode after some rigorous charging of a dozen dead tablets. Decent for moderate use though.",3
B00YRYS4T4,R2CD9F53VEV12U,Great multi charging station.,"ANKER always puts out for quality items. This is a great solution for any multi device charging needs. We keep it on out kitchen island.

B07DMNPNSH,R1Q5KWZPSPWZU1,Small and saves counter space,So far so good! Compact and really saves a lot of counter space. I had bought another brand of this same item and it did not last long at all. Hoping this one will last longer. At least it has a one year warranty.,5

B07DC2MJR4,RTYVSS8I07BMQ,Did not charge an iPhone 8+ with Otterbox case,I bought this charger because a previous review stated it worked with Otterbox cases. The charger would not charge my phone with the case on but seemed to work fine with the case off. I liked the design and ease-of-use of this charger but unfortunately it isn’t practical for me to remove my Otterbox case every time I need to charge my phone.,4
B086SM2KWH,RJGKB4FW5AWHF,Great Product,Fast charging with phone case on. Great item for the price.,5
B01K9MQ8WW,RIMN1VU6TL5B3,Failed to perform as advertised!,The charger appears to be in perfect condition but after being plugged in for 90 minutes on my iPhones Xs while being used it will only charge 5 to 10%.

B08NX74PSM,R2MS3SFSWYEWZO,wireless benefit,"the magnet is not that strong when it is attached to a case but it does charge up my phone fast. The 15w charger for the new iphones without paying the premium price tag of an apple wireless charger. This charges the iphone and gives that wireless charge display when attached to it on the back. As long as you don't move your phone around, it will be attached, but it does come lose when holding the phone and will come off the back unlike a plug would do.",5

B07THHQMHM,R2AYXSWHOOOWO9,Works nicely for my Samsung Galaxy S8,"I wanted to have an easy way to charge my phone without unfastening the case latch...it is handy to place it on top of the charger. I put the charger in a handy place, next to where I put my car keys when I get home.",5

B0734RKVLT,R1R70ZNJA628VU,Carefully worded description is misleading. Does not charge two devices at high speed.,"This device only puts out a maximum of 2.1 amps. Not per port. That's 2.1 amps total. At the time of this writing, the description says, ""Dual-USB output with total current 5V/2.1A and input with 100-240V enables you to charge two mobile devices simultaneously at high speed."" Yes, they do say the total current is 2.1A, but it's right after they say it has dual-USB output and right before they claim you can charge two devices simultaneously at high speed. High speed means 2.1 amps for each device. It's my contention that most people are going to believe that this item puts out 2.1 amps simultaneously from both ports. It doesn't.",1

B07VG9JZVG,R9G5DVNYBSF7X,Not worth the effort,Very unsatisfied with product. It works only when it wants to. It will only do super fast charging half of the time and often stops charging on its own randomly. It has been doing this since I bought it. I had hoped it was just a fluke but as I continue to use it the more frustrated I become. It has a pretty short cord and is annoying to plug in and out in hope that it will decide to charge.,1

B09HK72DD8,R1K5FDQV5YFW40,"Position versatility, but suction could be better","Out of the box this looked promising with versatility in the various locations you can use it. On first use, the mount would stick to the car windshield, but by the morning it would be on the floor or the moment I hook up my phone to the mount it falls off the windshield. Then tried the vent mount (although I didn’t want to use it there), but the mount doesn’t stay in the vent at all.
Finally tried mounting to the dash, although I was afraid it would mark up my dashboard. Here it worked best and the adhesion seemed super strong, working well for few weeks. Then, found it on the floor one morning. Tried using few drops of water to re-engage the suction adhesion (poor/no instructions on how exactly to get adhesion to re-engage). It would stay for maybe an hour without a phone attached. Now I’ve rinsed the suction under a faucet. It definitely has better adhesion again and holds my phone. Hopefully will last a few weeks before I have to repeat the process.
On the plus side, the charging is great. My iPhone 13 max doesn’t connect perfectly to the magnet in the intended orientation, at least not without finely maneuvering with two hands (which you aren’t able to do while driving). But I was easily able to bypass that issue by leaving my phone in the 90 degree orientation compared to intended use (mount is vertical but my phone is horizontal or vice versa). I have no problems with using it like that and it connects quickly to the magnet. One upgrade would be to have the cable input be at the back of the mount instead of at the bottom. This way you could route the charging cable straight back and then down some seem of your car interior, to better hide the cable.",2
B08PNW423Q,R10ZJNM2C86BNS,Flimsy,"The first day I used this charging mount, the white part separated from the aluminum part as I disconnected the phone from the mount. I was able to snap it back together and it worked for a while but I have to be really careful when disconnecting my phone or it comes apart. I finally added a strip of packing tape to hold the magnet to the casing. Also, the part that clips onto vent won’t stay closed around the vent so I have to play with that also. I’ll make do until I can find another option.",2

B07GTZ89NH,R151B2IONYA2TG,All info is in description,"All info is in the description
The charger works as described.

Quiescent current draw is 15mA, so if a vehicle is seldom driven or this is used with a small (low capacity) battery, it is best wired to a switched power connection (this is mentioned in the description for motorcycle wiring)

I'm not sure how much current the display consumes, if it is a substantial amount of the 15mA, then it would be a much better design if the display was only active when it was providing a charge (let's say a draw of 100mA or greater)

B07VSMK849,R3U7MLIYHPRXSS,This works great. I am constantly working on carrying less stuff. This has greatly helped.,I love it. I would love it more if it offered one more USB-C port. When I connect this to my MacBook Pro I pick up more ports with it so it is not a problem.,5

B08L5NP6NG,R2JFL5VOKPFR44,Took 3 tries to find compatible box,"It took me 3 tries to find a compatible charging brick. 20W Belkin brick from Walmart would only charge the phone for 10 min, then stop. Same issue with 18W Google brick. Finally had to drive 15 miles to the Apple store to buy their charging brick which magically worked with the MagSafe. The apple employee told me that they don’t provide the box with the iPhone or the MagSafe charger to be “environmentally conscious.” I don’t buy it… took me over 30 miles in gas to go to Walmart and the Apple store to buy different boxes. Not to mention the extra packaging for selling the brick separately. After all this, I charged my phone for just an hour with the MagSafe and the bottom of my phone got concerningly hot…think I’m just going back to my generic wireless charger.",3
B07RHPXT5K,R2TSYUJQCESFNC,Great little economical charger!!!,This charger is high quality and charges my devices very quickly! I am very satisfied with it. I ordered multiple chargers due to the low price. Don't hesitate to order. You won't be disappointed!,5
B09HNPY9LG,R1KWJ40Z4K3EWZ,Great Mag Charger,So far I love this charger. The magnetic hold is strong enough to hold the phone and I can turn the phone in any direction. It also isn't so strong that I rip the charger off my bed stand when I want to remove my phone. I definitely recommend this charger.,5

B079KZ49PJ,RZFOGATI7EGM8,Just buy the Yootech adapter when u buy the charger,"Happy so far with the charger. I’ve only been using it for about a month so a little early to comment on the durability & longevity of the product. But, so far so good. I will say however, if u buy this particular charger, save yourself the headache & JUST GO AHEAD & BUY THE YOOTECH ADAPTER AS WELL. It was $19.99. Kind of disappointing since the charger was only $14.99 but oh well. Was initially using the charger with one of my extra iPhone chargers. Didn’t foresee a problem. Good quality adapter, not one of those gas station products. Charger would not stay charging, would quit working constantly. Tried different adapters, different cords, different outlets, in the case, out of the case. After 2 wks of this BS, I broke down & just bought the damn adapter. Been working great now for a couple wks. No complaints. Charges my iPhone X to 100% every time. Woulda been nice if the thing woulda just come WITH the appropriate adapter. Hope this helps someone & saves you some time & distress. Woulda easily given this product 5 stars if it wouldn’t have have been such a hassle in the beginning.",3

B07WZKK6VM,R1DG484VFKC38C,Great Product,"This is basically a base charger with two stands where you plug in the charger cords for your Apple Watch and Airpods. So, each electronic is charging separately. You snap your Apple Watch cord into the circular holder and snap your Air Pod cord into through the bottom of the base. So, you will still use the cords that come with these items. Your Smart Phone lays on the charging base, which comes with its own cord. Keep in mind you will need some kind of three-way outlet/adapter or surge protector strip to plug all three cords. Great product!",5

It would not connect to my brand new phone. The USB connector on the charger just didn't fit much less, charge. Disappointed, I contacted the seller through Amazon. The seller said they have a warranty and shipped a new one immediately. The replacement arrived two days later. I love this thing. The USB plug fits perfectly and has a little bit of a ""click"" to hold it in. Connected to my new phone and it said 'Rapid Charging' so I have to think that the ratings are true. I'm sorry that the first one was a dud, but the company stepped-up and now I'm gonna tell everyone. It has clean looks and appears durable. I am very happy with this purchase.",5

B07FM8R7J1,R20OXHV7AICTAJ,"Sleek and cool, but has a bright light and a loud frequency buzz","I love the look of this wireless charger, it looks really sleek. It can charge my phone even with a case and a pop socket on. However, I have a couple issues with it and will not use it as my everyday, overnight charger.

First, the sound of it is annoying. The ""fast-charging"" capabilities make it emit a high frequency buzzing noise and is not good for sleeping right next to. If it is across the room from where you sleep it will probably be fine.

The second issue I have is the lights on it. It lights up green when your phone is not on the charger, and it lights up blue when it is charging. It is a pretty bright light, and it could honestly be used as a night light lol. Anyways, the bigger issue is that it STAYS lit up green whenever you have it plugged in. It's just a waste of electricity honestly... I unplug it every day to save electricity, which is inconvenient if you just want to plug it in and forget about it. I'll be purchasing a wireless charger that doesn't have lights, but I don't think I can get away from the buzzing noise of fast-chargers.",3

I plugged it in, put the watch on at 31% charge, went down stairs, cooked eggs - ate the eggs with some salad (it was yummy) and then came back to check on the charge and it was only at 47%.

cooking+eating probably took me about 30 minutes.

then I took the cable that came with the apple watch and plugged it in and the watch went from 47% to 64% in about 10 minutes. so, clearly this 150 dollar device isnt doing what it says it does. will be returning it.",1

Each night when going to bed i place my watch on the charger and I have to move it around until if finds the spot to make it charge. Then when I get up in the morning my watch is super hot to the touch and the cellular won’t work properly until the watch cools down. The phone charger is very finicky as well and you have to move the phone around to get in just the right spot for the charge to work. And the green light that turns on when properly charging is very bright. Will not be continuing use of this product. Afraid it will damage my devices.,1

Same issue when charging a half dozen other items. I tried other cables, same issue, so I know it's the charging block. I finally just threw it away. Probably should have gone through a return process, but I was sick and tired of looking at the thing.

B07GWR9V1N,R2F00T9QPCXW2J,Charges fast if your expectations are realistic,Got this charger and the Anker usb c to lightning cable to fast charge my iPhone X. The speed of the first few charges was only average. So I read up on fast charging. If your phone battery is very low it will charge very quickly up to about 50%. The speed is awesome. Above 50% the speed is nothing special. So if your battery doesn’t often get below 50% I wouldn’t recommend fast charging. Otherwise I would highly recommend for those time when you’re really drained and need to get quickly charged.,5

B07BKL7B9R,RS7BFUP9GT4N6,Charges super quickly,Gosh I love this. No more crinkled iPhone chargers breaking all the time!!! Charges rapidly too,5
B07R6CFW81,R37PVYC6IW6DKI,Failure,"Do not waste your money!! I bought it in September 2020 as a back up charger, it’s Oct 30 and it stopped working. Return window closed a week ago",1
B077HFFLMS,RAJ8O7UNCFEND,No difference in charging time,"It isn’t what it advertised still takes the same amount of time to fully charge my iPhone than a regular charger, no what I expected

After talking to customer service changed the rating from two to one star. Asked them if it doesn’t charge the phone fast like how it’s advertised then what exactly is the point of this and they responded saying they didn’t understand the question",1
B07FM8R7J1,R1TDU5RFKJNKNO,This charger is... just okay.,"What can I say? It's an alright charger. It isn't the best, deserving of a 5 star review, nor is it the worst, meriting a 1 star. In my opinion, it fell short of my expectations because I hardly use it but it was only $12 so who cares?

The reason I'm disappointed in it is that it is a slower charge. What takes an hour and a half on the wireless charger will take about an hour, or less, by using the wall charger. It's not terrible but usually I need my phone fast and don't want to wait the extra 30 or 45 minutes. Because of the slow charging, I rarely use it, favoring traditional charging methods.

I do, however, use if I need to charge my phone in bed. It's perfect for setting on a nightstand and being able to just set it down to charge but other than that, I don't use it much. The constant light could also be distracting while trying to sleep but I will usually cover it once my phone is charged.

Lastly, I feel I should note that if you have a popsocket, you may need to move your phone around until it starts charging. You can't always just set it down and instantly begin charging, sometimes you need to move it to get it to work.

Overall, I'd buy it with the expectation of using it for convince, not super fast charging or as a replacement for your normal charger. The end, thanks for reading.",3
B09KM2Z4J5,RNZ026NSG0INI,Great for any use,This is another product that is a must have. Especially for those who travel. I visited NewYorkCity this past weekend and took this along to try its use while traveling and I absolutely love the ease of use this thing offers. I took it out of my bag and plug it in unfolded it and WaLa all three of my gadgets charging all at once. Go purchase this thing quick it’s not wasted money like other chargers. And it saves you cash because it’s 3 in 1 so you only need to purchase one charger and you get three.,5

B01BMDQ9U8,RZ0B29KX2S047,This unit from Ruckus Seller was NOT new.,"I already own a Samsung charger so I know what it's supposed to look like and how it is supposed to work. The one I ordered previously was sold by Amazon, not a third party. The one I bought previously worked great (and is still working great!) which is why I wanted another one to keep in another room. Charges FAST! Has a small built-in cooling fan to keep heat down. And I like that it stands the phone up in either landscape or portrait mode so I can sit and read emails or watch a video while the phone is in the charger. So, the device itself, new, is great.

However, I didn't realize I was buying from a third party and not Amazon on this purchase. In most instances, that isn't a problem. There are plenty of great third part sellers operating through Amazon. But in this instance, my experience was bad. You can see from the pictures that the unit definitely isn't new. I thought the packaging looked strange with the tape on the box not being quite right, but the magnetic plastic protective sheath made it obvious something was wrong since it had collected much dust and debris which clearly didn't come from inside the box. Also, the base of the unit appears to have been glued back into place. Excess glue is very visible all over the base. I am returning the unit for full refund. I decided to take 10 minutes and drive over to Best Buy to get what I wanted instead of ordering another one from Amazon and risk the porch pirates snagging my stuff.",1

B077XQJ2FK,R3H0A779C5GMJ6,Important asset for frequent travelers,"I travel often for work and have found this power brick to be incredibly useful. I use this to charge two USB devices at once, namely my phone and my headphones. This is especially useful when I stay at a hotel where the only power outlet close to the bed allows for a single device to plug in. The dimples on the sides are also a great feature for providing grip when pulling the adapter out of the outlet. Overall, these feel substantial and well-made.

I purchased it to replace a wireless charger with a ""keys sensing"" function to turn off the charger if you accidentally set something on it other than your phone, but it constantly turned off when my phone was on it unless I took my case off. This TOZO charger works great with my case on. I also have one of those removable popwallets that snaps onto a plastic base stuck to my phone case, so I end up with my case + an extra plastic piece when I want to charge my phone, and it still charges great with no issues.

It was driving me crazy! I looked around on Amazon and came across this gem! It’s a great deal considering it not only includes a cord but also a block? Sorry I’m not sure what the proper term is. The cord is long and thicker than the average cord so hopefully this will make it more durable. I can’t say anything on the durability as I’ve only had it for a day but it definitely fast charges!! Overall great product, if you’re looking for an affordable fast charger I recommend this one!",5

Initially it was charging like I liked and I reached out to the company/seller and they reached back right away. They stepped up to the plate and made sure I was happy with my order.

My charger chargers all my devices at the same time with no issues on my night stand which i like very much. Look at my pictures and you’ll see the night light which allows me to find my devices at night without having to feel around.

My wife likes that the phone seems to hang in the air while charging and wants me to order her one as well. If I don’t, she might take mine!

I liked that I can charge all at once and the seller made sure I was happy with my order. It’s never fun when you have issues and the seller doesn’t care. I would definitely recommend buying this product from this seller.",5

B0734SN6VR,R12OCQDTQG7OBH,Good product for travel and everyday use,"Bought these along with the charging cord pack with multiple lengths for my long distance boyfriend who had been using his car charger as his sole charging spot.

He kept putting off buying more because he travels a lot for work and didn't see the need to get a wall port when he's in his car most of the time. So I Amazon primed him a pack of chargers to his house.

He was leaving for a trip the next day with his friends. He used them at the airport and every hotel he went too. He shared the charger with his friends and was so excited he had to many so he could.

Anyway, he's had them about a month and they all still work and hes still very happy that he has them. I will gladly give an update in a couple of months if to say whether or not they still work! But right now, very happy with the quality and the price.

B07PM578PW,R1U4G67DOKP3KI,Way better than most retail charging pads,Ive compared this charging pad to a couple that i sell while at work and its way better than any others I've tried. this model for some reason seems even better than some of the other models that anker makes and its great to see one product be so much better than its older counterparts. its charging speed is great for a wireless charger and works pretty seamlessly. Now it doesn't charge as fast as the newer apple 18 watt block and a couple of the Samsung blocks but as a wireless charger it easily makes up for the lack of charging speed with convenience and in the end it Isn't that much slower since i cant just lay the phone down and forget about it instead of having to go dig for a charger or plug it in and risk it falling or damaging the port as I've had happen to some of my older phones.,5

B08J49THFB,R595NPYY1ZVGN,Not sure,I have had this now for the past three weeks and the USB cord on it is very touchy. It doesn't want to stay plugged in and the problem I don't like is it is a cord that is specific to unit. You can't use your own cord. I'm not sure at this point if I would recommend it because of the hassle of making sure its plugged in and staying plugged in to the unit.,3

B08K8DNVB4,R1OYEZ6PCBM8A1,Works great,It has a very simple set up. It is plugged in place so you just plug the charger that came with it into an outlet and place your items on the rack.

The device is small enough to put on a desk or small table and still not get in the way. Takes more time to charge then a mini usb, but its nice to just plop your phone down instead of looking for a cord.

B072K6BLJJ,RACC5AI8OP1M5,Anker does it again,Works great for my nephew's ipod touch combined with the 10ft lightning cable. He was raving about it to me during christmas. This isn't my first anker product and I've stick with the brand since. Always tell my friends and family about this brand.,5

B09GLQV72Z,R3BLHHZ5OR2KOL,Not working with me,Doesn't charge fast and my iwatch 5 not charging,1
B06XSD2DK7,R7LDRT9WYNCPV,Premium carbon fiber look is so cool,"The integrated 3ft PowerLine II Dura cable is more than enough length for anybody in the front seats and no risk of being pulled out of the charger because its connected securely. The charger itself fits snuggly and feels like a secure connection with the car. This is a cost savings if you have to buy a charger and a cable. This cable doesn't leave the charger, so it will always be there when you need it. In the past people have ""borrowed"" my cables and I didn't have it when I needed it, that can't happen here. In my experience cables fail near the connections, Anker has added reinforcements to the adapter side and the connector side. My only worry about these kind of intergraded cables is if something happens to the cable and you can't replace it. Anker says PowerLine II Dura Cables will last 12,000+ bends. Anker seems to have addressed this by reinforcing the areas that fail. If you don't like the intergraded cable Anker also sells the same charger without the integrated cable and has two USB ports if you don't use lightning connections or want to use your own cables.

24 watts Quick Change 3 and Power IQ deliver the exact amount of amps needed for fast charging on the go. Soft blue backlight makes finding the USB port easy in the dark and is not distracting. Quickly charged a full sized iPad Air 2 without problems. Apple MFi certified. Charged an iPhone 7 plus and iPad Air 2 at same time. Voltage boost means you can use longer cables to people in the back seat and still deliver full speed charging to passengers. Included is a 18-month warrenty. Feels sturdy and will likely use it for many years. I would highly recommend it.",5
B093KLMWXZ,R3JD44E18UY4Q6,Great alternative,I don't know what some of the other customers are saying... Sometimes it's user error in my opinion but this charger is really good. Stuck right to my phone when I attached it. Maybe you guys are using the wrong case for magsafe charging.,5
B09L824FJL,R1XASTMCNCCRT0,It sucks,"First one didn’t charge, it would start to charge and then would shut off. I got a replacement and that one took more than 8 hours to charge my iPhone 11 from 63%to 96%. I put my AirPod Pros to charge and in 4 hours, they had only gone up 3%. Terrible product.",1

Yes, you have to be a little bit finicky with the phone placement, but it is obvious when you have it right (the charging light the charger and the phone go on) and it's not really all that hard. Charging times are the same as with a regular corded charger. I would give this 5 stars, but it will only work with the supplied Samsung wall adapter (I was hoping I could just plug it into my RAV Power 6 port station).",4

B08K8DNVB4,R1WA4I236ZKXRR,Doesn’t last long,"UPDATE 10/3/21: sadly I had to take 3 stars off my original review, because these only worked properly for about 3 months. In some cases less. I purchased 5 of these (4 in the original order 1 replacement) and none of them made it past 3 months. After trying again with one that died after 1 month, I gave up. Upsetting because the design is perfect and when they worked they were unbeatable. Hope they continue to improve on them — may give them another try if they come out with an updated version.

B07VG9JMG1,R3CXH6OHY6WYPE,very good,"my review is for the 15W wireless fast charge 2.0 stand.

design, engineering and attention to detail are insane ... it has intricately designed internal airflow to provide quiet cooling on a level not seen in any other charger. older Samsung chargers have a fan too, but the internal airflow is nowhere as efficient as in this unit.

when i charge the phone in my car's wireless charger it gets almost too hot to touch. when i charge it on my portable and fanless samsung wireless charger it gets hot. when i charge it on my old samsung fan cooled charger it gets warm. on this charger it just stays cold.

i wasn't able to test the speed because between all my chargers my phone is pretty much always at over 80% and i'm not going to drain it just to test the speed.

why did i get it then if i don't need the extra speed ? i like the compact stylish design and how it orients the phone towards me and i like the quiet but powerful cooling.

why 4 stars ?

2 reasons:

1 - the cable it comes with is too short. i had to buy a 6 foot cable separately to replace the included 3 foot cable. i used an Anker brand Type C to Type C ""powerline"" cable and it works fine.

2 - my anker charger on the other hand will NOT work with this wireless charger. AT ALL. luckily this wireless charger includes a 25W samsung super fast charger which works perfectly but the fact of the matter is i never had a single device ( Samsung or otherwise ) not work with my Anker charger before, which is a fairly recent and high end charger but not a Type C charger.

overall these are nit picks though. i recommend this product without hesitation and in fact i'm thinking about getting a second one even though i already have several wireless chargers.",4
B07V3B5SRW,RNFAFMBBDJZQ7,Good Value,"Initially, I gave a poor review since I wasn't getting a fast charge. However after the first day or so, everything has worked great. Only think I wish would work, is that for whatever reason I've not succeeded in using in my car for Android Auto.",4

B07RHSD9WM,R1G9H16D8O5N04,"Beware, description is misleading.","The description says it charges iPhone 12 Pro, which I have. It does not come with a compatible cable to do that. The problem is that the cable that comes with the charger is usb-c to usb-c, and the iPhone 12 Pro charge port requires a Lightning cable. Useless to me. Waste of money.",1
B087MDHQMB,R3J3FHRPJ1BXPP,Superfast charge and looks great!,"The quality of these adaptors is solid. There are many lighter blocks and wall chargers on the market and immediately when you pick it up you can tell it is different. Plugs in tightly and blends into our power strip near bed. Charges our phones super fast and comes in a variety of colors, which is excellent for different preferences. Love it!",5
B07SKJ5XM6,R3LMI9101WPQS3,It works,Seems to work so far. Box was ripped open upon arrival but I don’t think anything was missing,5
B077HFFLMS,R2NWGTQTJ6HDEZ,seems like a quality product,It was packaged like an Apple product which gives the impression of a quality product. I plugged it in and the wireless charger worked fine. I had tried to the charger with the white cube that came with the phone but it stopped working after awhile. I charge it at night so I don't know if it is faster or not. But it works well.,4
B08J49THFB,R281P1G532NZD0,Slim and Handy,"This doodad is the coolest thing. You just plop your phone (has to be iPhone 8 or newer folks) and bam, it starts charging. The charging cable is a USB-C cable. That is a big plus. I plugged it to the back of my desktop in one of the USB ports so that I can charge whatever needs it.",5
B09B368YG4,R8TBQRRHXYQVN,Works as advertised!,"This device works well with my Galaxy s8. I saw some comments about difficulty in lining up the phone on the pad, not true. I almost throw my phone on top of it and I get a charging tone very easily. It also fast charges well.",5
B01J3S9I7K,R2ZR42U3ADP8O8,Doesn't fit,"I really wanted to like this product, but it does not fit in my 2010 round cigarette lighter ports.",1
B07L1N7RG8,R197F7R19FYC4N,"Small, unobtrusive, and it works","I bought these because we were tired of having to occupy multiple outlets for charging various USB devices, and these seemed to offer a good combination of small size and a decent number of USB ports. They work as advertised and were priced very reasonably.",5
B09N6RJ37K,R1WOD9QMPP27K,This product is absolutely amazing. I can feel the difference in my back ...,"This product is absolutely amazing. I can feel the difference in my back pain ever since I got this product. I cant believe I never bought this product from before. It's small, compact, soft, and it very comfortable to use, and it comes with a little carry case which is awesome. This is a must buy product.",5
B08JXGV9GK,R27ONBKJVVD4ZQ,DONT BUY,It works fine at first but stops working after a few days. Don’t waste your money.,1
B0894TL5JG,R37KDQY8B7JN2G,Charges 2 out of 3 devices fine,"I like that it charges my Samsung phone, watch and earbuds all in one device & it takes up very little space! The charging on the watch and earbuds is pretty fast but it charges my phone super slow. I had my phone on the charger for about 6 HOURS and it was only at 90% so I still have to use a separate charger which I was hoping to avoid.",3
B07WYCJLS7,R3NXQLNYZM3I2C,Perfectly simple and well-priced wireless charging,I purchased the Anker PowerWave Pad primarily to charge my Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds. It works exactly as one would expect. On the plus side is the great price. On the negative side I have two gripes: (1) as with most devices these days the power adapter isn't included so you have to provide your own which makes the item cost less but you still need to have a spare adapter to use or purchase another one and (2) the cord length could be a little longer. I had to use a short extension cord to get it to reach the outlet from where the charger is located on a dresser which is an annoyance. Other than those two things the device is perfection. I'd definitely buy another one if I were in need.,5
B0775JCC27,R3GNX42WVTERRC,Works for all current devices,"We bought this to get rid of multiple ""wall warts"" that were cluttered onto a surge protector strip. This device appears to detect which devices are able to take a quick charge and which ones are legacy devices. We have not had an issue with rapid charging of older devices beyond what they were designed for, but the newer devices charge just as fast as if they were plugged into the original manufacturer's AC adapter.",5
B07PWC32ZD,RZHSGKLWOUV7U,Awesome quick charger for devices,I got this primarily to charge my Nintendo Switch while playing. This can quick charge the Switch using the high power USB C and the USB A is good for normal operation or charging overnight. I wouldn’t call it a travel size but given the power it’s not a bad size. My only wish was the USB C port was another A because it’s rare to get something with a C to C cable.,4
B08S766222,R3E3UCXTB0BW5R,works good,long cord.,5
B01CH9NEM2,RIU4S3EYBKKRX,Nexus 6p fast charging approved,"Purchased this for use with my Nexus 6p. The charger arrived well packaged which gave it a bit of a premium feel. It has a modern jet black look with a lazer cut accent. There is a small blue LED that glows when plugged in indicating it is receiving 12v from your car charger. The glow is very faint and not overwhelming which is a plus. When plugged in it only protrudes about 1.5"" from the cars 12v charger. This charger does support the fast charging feature which is the main reason for purchasing it. Now I can charge my phone to 100% in my vehicle and it only takes about an hour.

I did opt for the coiled version but if I had to repurchase I would go with the straight cord. Comparing this to the PC sync cord that comes with your Nexus 6p it is about the same length. In its coiled state it sits around 10"". If I stretch it out with a fair amount of pressure it stretches to around 20"" or so. I have purposely stretched my coils so that they sit around this length naturally. The item description says it can stretch between 100 to 150cm, which is about 40 to 60 inches. That is simply unrealistic. At best the cord reaches around 40 inches when fully stretched.

The biggest problem with the coiled version is that you will always have the resistance of the coil tugging at the charging port in your phone. Even though I have purposely stretched out the the coils so that they are at a more relaxed state, I find myself having to support the connection to my phone with a finger repeatedly for one main reason. I feel like over time it will prematurely wear out the the port on my phone from the charger jack tugging at an angle. This would clearly be a non issue with the straight cord. The only positive thing about the coiled version is that it looks neater when not in use. If you don't use your phone at any point while in the vehicle, and just simply need a ""dock"" to charge, I would recommend the coiled version. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above, I would recommend going with the straight cord instead. Either way I am extremely happy that now I can fast charge my phone while on the go. I would definitely recommend this product.

Update: After almost exactly 1.5 years I need a replacement. The cord started to fray at the connection to the point where it was no longer charging. Not a bad investment.",5
B077XS5LSD,R322322FT6UEE0,"Works perfectly, and a great value","Does the job! Prongs don’t fold down so it’s not ideal for travel, but the TWO USBs is convenient, they’re small, and work fine. Have bought a couple of times and charged many different devices flawlessly.",5

B07X32ZLM5,R1B4E0JJV6NUDM,Charges faster right out of the box,"I just received this and wanted to share, I will update if any data is proved inaccurate later. I opened the box, plugged it in, and took my Note 9 off the wireless charger it was on to place on this charger and the charge time was cut in half! It has a sleek look, a great plug/USB adaptor and the charge indicator is bright and clear. If it keeps charging in half the time I might have to buy another.",5
B093KYZ3K4,R2HC6TRLCRH23U,It’s all good,I feel like it was time consuming putting it all together. Once I got it together and cords where they needed to be the phone part didn’t charge my phone at all.,2

B07DPT9SK4,RVMUE680FE71T,Great Product,"It works perfectly. As soon as I set my phone on the platform, a blue light appears indicating that it connected. It even worked with my phone case still attached. It's very lightweight and has grips on the bottom so that it doesn't slide off a surface. Overall, great product.",5
B01N68AMCU,R3AB21WA5T3AC8,Nice double,They are great but wish they were a bit smaller in width so they fit a little better in my power strip. They can grow in the other dimensions if needed. They work fine and are a good value,4

B07WZKK6VM,R1LK7QVXYBNRVW,Not worth it!,"Works decent enough, my issue is it only came with one usb cable that powers the wireless charger but no box for the outlet. You also have to provide your own watch charger (understandable) as well as your own charger for the AirPods. Then you’re left with so many cables and having to figure out how to plug everything in! Don’t waste your time and money. There are similar options that are way better.",1
B07KVQXJSY,R3FVFE188ACD46,Power plug overheats,"Received this package in good condition, however 3 days after using it the usb fast charge power plug started to overheat and not charging my device. So i used one of my old usb fast charge power plugs and seems to do the trick.",1

It is never consistent, but has never charged faster than 5W. All around I enjoy the product and is a great way to save space on your desk, while look fashionable and organized. I would recommend, just don't expect super fast charging speeds.",4

There are two chargers in this pack and each charter comes with a wire. There is no adapter included, but you can use your own.

I like the fact it charges many different types of phones and accessories so very convenient for a family that uses different brands of deviced. When using it, it charged Apple iPhone very well and quite quickly, so I recommend them.",4

B08L5NP6NG,RPVPGT1X8HAS5,Charges quickly and avoids the typical Qi charger issues,"I finally broke down and bought this when it was on sale and I had a coupon to bring the price down to more reasonable levels. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. MagSafe charges my iPhone 12 mini faster than Qi, and I never wake up to find that my phone was just a bit out of position and didn't charge overnight.

While it's tempting to put the MagSafe charger in some sort of base that will stick it to a surface and let you treat it more like a Qi charging pad that you set the phone on, I think it works most reliably if you leave it loose, hold the phone just over it and let the magnets do their thing and snap the charger into place. I've heard of people having issues with charging if they treat it like a Qi pad and the magnets don't align just right, but I've never had an issue.",5

B09N982NDT,R1GE34ULOCTFO3,Fails to charge apple watch,"I liked the layout the best of all the chargers I considered, but if it fails to do the one thing I need it for nothing else matters. Will not charge my Apple watch, it might say its charging but it seems like the magnet holding the watch on is too weak and lets it slip down out of range. This in infuriating when you set it on there and see the watch show its starting to charge only to come back to a dead watch every single time. After failing to get a charge a dozen times I had to give up and return it. Too bad cheap execution ruined what could be a nice item.",2
B00UCZGS6S,R339CFSYCIKI01,NOT A GOOD BUY,Wireless for this charger means you don't have to run a cord to your phone. It takes 3 hours to charge my Galaxy when the charger is plugged in and 6 if it is not at which point the charger needs to be charged. At least with a long cord I can still use the phone while it is charging. You get what you pay for. Don't waste your money.,1

B0894TL5JG,R123ZN5QSXM8ZX,Works really well,"This charger works well with my Samsung 21 Ultra even with a plastic case on the back that has a kickstand. Charges my watch as well. (Samsung Active 2). Although, the watch charger part, I think, needs like a sight dip to help line it up better. I do not have ear phones so not sure about that part. I am happy with this as I tried a similar style from another company and it would not charge my phone with the case on.",4
B093FDLLKW,R3Q5JOMJUCBB74,Awesome product 👏🏻,"Product works as expected. It was very easy to setup and I haven’t had any issues with the suction cup which was my only concern. However, since it came with the air vent choice as well, even that wouldn’t have been that big of a deal to just use the air vent instead of suction cup.

A nice surprise was it came with a MagSafe magnet in case I didn’t have one on my current case. I wouldn’t suggest putting it on your phone directly, in case it didn’t work, but what a great option instead of investing in an expensive case!

Overall, awesome product. 10/10 would recommend.",5
B09B385PDW,RAFEPQ89V9NOX,I currently own a $112 desk charger that dos not charge disconnected,"I love everything Anker so I was excited about this product. Magsafe charger that actually sticks to the phone like an Apple product does. I use the charger at work. It sits on my desk and charges my phone and AirPods. When I leave for the day, the portable portion leaves with me and gets me through the evening and my morning workout before returning to work. I really liked this charger until, I was taking my phone out of my bag and bumped the charger off. The charger hit the ground and boom, no more portable charging. It wasn’t a high drop and the pack didn’t bounce. I live in Hawaii so on a trip to the main land, I was excited to get this before flying back but now there is no replacing it. It works plugged in but I have other less expensive Anker products that do that.",1

Charger doesn’t work when both an Apple Watch and iPhone are placed in their respective spots. Also need to take off iPhone case to allow phone to charge.

It’s great that the charger was packaged with 2 cords (usb to c and c to c). I am using the c to c for the charger and put the usb to c in my travel bag for different device.

B07DBXZZN3,RCKKWM10VT7QA,Wireless charger works great but the included cable is a short and did not include charging block,"Update (8/2022) - Shortly after this review it stopped charging. Changing the charging block to one with a higher amperage fixed the issue.

I’m a big fan of Anker products so I opted to get this over other cheaper brands.

So far the charging stand seems to work fine with my wife’s iPhone SE and my iPhone 6s (via mophie’s wireless battery case).

We did have trouble getting it to work initially with her phone because she had a magnet on her case so that she can mount it in her car for hands-free calling/GPS. The charging light would come on but it would flash repeatedly. Once we removed the magnet, it worked as expected.

That said, I really do wish it came with a longer cable. The cable’s length is okay if your desk is situated right next to a wall outlet, but if you’re trying to reach anything farther... say a power strip on the floor, you might have trouble reaching It without being very selective in where to position the charging stand on said desk.

One last note - as mentioned in the description, this does NOT include a power adapter. Just adding that in case people missed it the first time.",4

Happily this product works exactly as described. Both my iPhone 12 and Apple Watch 7 are always fully charged in the morning, regardless of their battery status when I put them on the charger. I also like that the phone and watch stands fold flat for travel. The phone and watch can also charge when folded flat it you like.

In one situation I had to make a long video call on my phone and my battery was nearly dead. I put it on the stand which turned the phone at a usable angle for video, and it was charging during the video call. By the end of the call rather than a dead battery I was fully charged.

I recommend this product without hesitation.",5

B013WQGG1A,R2TXS84ENMBUKB,Works Fine but not like a Rapid Charger that comes with my Android,"Works OK. I have a few MicroUSB devices that will charge fine on this. I was purchased it in hopes that it provided more of a true Fast/Rapid Charge for my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active). This phone came with an Samsung Rapid Charger that does provide Fast Charging capability. What I mean is that when you plug in the Samsung Rapid Charger that comes with the phone, the phone will say ""Fast Charging"" in the notification of the charging status. Using this Device, even with the same cable and a shorter 1' cable the phone never reaches a Fast Charging status, maybe that has something to do with how the Samsung Charger is detected by the phone. Most of the time when I'd use this is at a hotel home when I need to charge a few things over night, so it works ok, but I think Rapid Charger is not quite the same when compared to rapid chargers that come with phones now.",4

B08FBFJDQ1,R3UZS801M405SY,Don't buy!! Worked for one day,"This charger does not work. It worked for one day. The first day I was able to charge my watch so I could get it up and running for the first time. The watch's battery doesn't last as long as advertised - - it only lasted 30 hours. So, between setting the watch up and using it for a total of 1 day, I needed to recharge it. This charger wouldn't work on only the second time I tried to use it. It stopped working/charging within less than a day after receiving it! I was only able to use my brand new watch for approximately 30 hours.

BACKSTORY: I purchased a Galaxy watch 4. THE DESCRIPTION CLEARLY STATED THAT IT CAME WITH A basic charger included. The basic charger was not in the box when my watch arrived. I searched Amazon for the basic charger which lists at $29.99. It is not available through any seller. It's also not available on Samsung's official website. The Galaxy watch 4 requires a charger that has to Qi technology. The previous generations and styles of galaxy watch chargers do not have this technology and will not charge the Galaxy 4s. You must buy charger specifically designed for Galaxy 4 watches. Thus, I was forced to buy this overpriced duo charger in order to use my new watch. It feels like a contrived effort to suck more money out of the consumer! Why are there no basic chargers available for purchase when these watches are brand new and not compatible with other previous generation chargers? I repeat: you can't just go out and buy a third party charger because of the Qi technology. You can only charge your Galaxy 4 with the official Samsung charger that has the new Qi technology. You can't use other Samsung chargers that are used for previous model watches - they don't have the same technology. Believe me I tried this initially!!

What a disappointing experience with both my purchase of the watch and my purchase of the charger. These watches are not cheap. I spent a lot of money only to receive my new watch and not be able to use it.

Then, when I received the duo charger I charged my watch and used it for one day. When I went to recharge the watch on day two it wasn't working.

Man! I'm really rethinking my choice of watches. I don't know what Samsung was thinking between bad battery life, bad battery charging products and a scarcity of their basic charging products. I should have gone with my first choice of the Fitbit Sense, which can do everything this overpriced watch can do for a whole lot less money.",1

One minor thing to be aware of is the wide watch charger. If you use solo bands with a small wrist, you will kinda of have to stretch it over the charger to get it on and off. This is a very minor issue but perhaps it’s helpful to be aware of.

The included 20w charger has an extra USB port which is a bonus.",5

This one caught my eye as it had two ways to secure it in the car (adhesive mount and a vent mount) and it was reasonably priced. I use the adhesive mount in my car. My experience with it has been very good. My phone stays in place and has never fallen out plus it charges while I'm driving without a cord. Just what I was looking for. I went ahead and got a second one for my wife's car!,5

B08QHH25X3,R1IJL0Z1FK5ZNB,Works great,It works great! It charges my phone through the case. It's also nice that it has a light on it that you can tap on and off. The charging cable is a little short which is my only complaint.,5

Once I was able to get this working it was great! on occasion I did have a problem with charging but I would use a different charging slot.

B09PGBDP66,R1U8GDKMFYKEC2,Great product/great price,I was skeptical at first to make this purchase due to the fact you get 3 charging blocks that are certified at such a great price! Thinking the charging speed would probably not be great. But it is!! Charges super fast! Love it!!,5

B07W624B8K,R3OMXJE1XZVZK0,Doesn't work well.,The product lasted about 2 weeks before it just stopped charging. Unplugging it and plugging it back in would get to start charging again but once you took the device off of the charger it wouldn't charge it anymore til unplugged and plug back in.,1
B078LSG2DX,R3VYXWNXQRS7RJ,Durable and fast charging!!,This is currently embedded in my center console because of how thin it is and how fast it charges. Older trucks didn’t have fun stuff like this but it doesn’t have to be that way!

B09PYHS59Z,R2JJX230NPR5F2,It works fine,"Product looks exactly as pictured. Functions fairly well. If you have a case for your phone, I recommend taking it off to charge. I have personally found that even my thin case makes the phone heat up tremendously while charging. Without the case, the phone charges without heating up. Added step makes using this a bit annoying. Also, you have to position the phone exactly correctly or else it won't charge. You should wait to see the green light come on and verify your phone is charging before walking away from it. Not a bad product for the price, but not sure I'll purchase again.",4

The standard Apple charger would fit here, but this is a little bigger. Seems to work fine when it fits. I'll probably look for a smaller one with a single USB port honestly.",3

The problem I have is that after a couple of minutes, these chargers will give off a very high-pitched, screeching whine until the device that is plugged into it is removed. Most of my family can't hear it but I, and some of my younger children / nieces / nephews can - and to us it is o
painfully loud. I have no idea what is causing this but I've not experienced this problem with other chargers.",3

B09QRWXL2C,R3AI7MXIRVHF4H,More bang for your buck over Apple’s traditional product,This product works great. There is no difference in the time-to-charge when comparing this to the official Apple licensed product. 2 6-foot cables and 2 20W charge ports make this a great value compared to Apple’s similar products which would run you $20 each for the cable and charge port.

As u see my phone sitting on it and the red lite on means it’s charging as u see how it says it on my phone as well. Once ur phone is fully charged then the light on the bottom is green. This docking station also lays flat for the people that don’t want to stand there phone up right. Works great defiantly glad I bought this for the good price that I did. Gonna buy another one for my kitchen so when I have my phone out there. Good to have one for each room possibly.,5

I took a chance and ordered this wireless charger and it works great. It is slower than using a cord once was, but I wasn't ready to upgrade the phone quite yet. I do have to pay attention to the lights on the phone and charger as sometimes the charger indicates it is charging then stops after a few minutes if the phone isn't on the charger in the right spot but it isn't difficult to keep it centered if I pay attention.",5

I’ve had it for about a month and at first I loved it, but after sitting on my night stand without being moved or touched- it now shorts out. It wasn’t dropped or played with. A few nights ago it started to charge the phone and then after about ten minutes it stopped. It did it again last night. This morning I was able to get it to charge for about an hour, but it only went from 22% to 56%. For the price, I didn’t expect it to be great. I just need to know that my phones going to actually charge over night so my alarm goes off in the morning.",4
B078LS9DY1,R3IUIRXY3QKSP6,Great charger,"Easy to use. Lays flat on counter and out of the way. I love the rose gold color. Yes it does take longer than a regular charger but if you're not in a hurry it's fine. I typically charge my phone first thing in the morning while having my coffee and then go get ready for the day. By the time I'm ready, the phone is ready. If you are in a hurry then charge by cord. You can't go wrong with this charger and it's reasonably priced.",5

Also have a CPAP in other socket so power drain? maybe. But when I pulled plug out it was a very ""loose fit"" in socket. Put it into a different and horizontal wall socket after squeezing the prongs together. Works fine. Think the weight and loose fit on the vertical socket prevented electrical contact.

B07DFGKFM3,RMMSWSIHANR4F,Alien technology!!!!,"So I’m totally convinced Anker is working at Area 51 with this new product line. If not that, they have totally developed a time machine and brought back this technology from the future for sure. This thing is basically the same size as my Apple IPad charger (10w) or even a little smaller, and packs 30w of power. Paired this with an Anker USB-C to lightning cable and an Anker USB-C cable to charge my iPhone X, iPad Pro, and MacBook. I have been testing it for a few weeks now and it’s amazing. It charges all my devices extremely fast, including my MacBook with the lid closed. Anker quality is second to none, I own at least 10 of their products and all are 10 out of 10, especially the cables. I reached out to Anker support the first day I got this item and they are top notch, why can’t other companies have customer service like this?! It’s amazing how a company like this can be so good at everything they do, and not sacrifice quality to make a quick buck. I will be purchasing the larger unit in this line as soon as it becomes Available for my desktop. Some people are taking a star off for the prongs not folding, if you look at the break away photos of this device you can clearly see the amount of electronics (from the future and/or aliens) that are packaged into this device. I carry it in a laptop bag so no big deal to me. I will post a follow up in a few months for durability testing. Photographs are of the Anker Atom with a J7-c digital tester using a USB-C to lightning cable plugged into an iPhone X that was at 89% charged.",5

B09Q2BCDHD,R3LCPLFEXVMYWJ,Fantastic 3-in-1 charger,"I am very impressed with this charger. It was able to fast charge my phone with a case on. Also able to charge both watch and airpods (with case on) at the same time as the phone. It really does everything it claims to do. Thank goodness the light on the stand has a power button so you can turn it off at night.

One of the most important things for this style of charger to work is using the appropriate adapter. Many common adapters cannot properly power a charger like this, but fortunately this includes the adapter you need to make it work right. You don't have to provide your own and then hope that it will work.

Some of these charges that claim to be 3-in-1 also require you to provide your own charger for the watch, but this one has a built in charging coil for the watch so you don't need to provide anything. It is good to go right out of the box.

Overall, I am very happy with this, especially at the $30 price point. I definitely recommend it.

When deciding on buying something I greatly depend on reviews from others, so I hope this helps you!",5

It will work for a little while but then the block just stops working entirely. I'm using it on a surge protector. I have no idea why it keeps killing my charging blocks but i'm going to have to stop using it because now I'm out 2 out of the 3 that I've had on hand for years. I've never had anything like this happen. If it takes a specific type of charging block, just send it with the product instead of making us figure it out as it damages our electronics.

UPDATE #2 The company responded again, quite quickly. They are sending me a different model, and said they are looking into the issue with the current one. They also want me to check and make sure the different model works. They seem to legitimately care, which is nice for a change :-) Again, I'll update the review when I receive a working product.

B07KVQXJSY,R8PO1U1HYJNJ9,A big disappointment,"From the get-go, this cable has not worked for file transfer from my phone to my PC. That was really annoying - it just never occurred to me that it wouldn't work for that. The listing itself doesn't mention file transfer but it does talk about compatibility with micro-USB and surely that should include the types of functions you would expect with any regular micro-USB cable? Anyway, I had another, shorter cable that I could use, so I forgave the lack of file transfer. At that point, I would have given 3 stars probably, since it's a good price point and the charger does work, including fast charging capability. Then, a week ago, my phone stopped charging. Upon checking, the micro-USB plug no longer fits snugly in the phone charging port, so it won't charge the phone unless you hold it in the plug at just right angle. So, ultimately, no file transfer and the micro-USB plug/cable is garbage. Still using the charger with that other shorter cable I mentioned so I'm going to grit my teeth and give this 2 stars. I'll update this to 1 star if the charger fails, which I'm sure will happen sometime in the next week or two.
Update: As expected, fast charging capability no longer works either. I think I got another couple of months out of it - now it charges like any other non-fast charging unit. Downgraded to 1 star, as promised.",1

B07PM578PW,REW524PM48GVB,Charges all my wireless products! Airpod Pros and iPhone 10X,"Originally, I had a monitor with a built-in wireless charging pad - since I got rid of that and needed a replacement... the Anker Wireless charging pad works great! I just set it and forget it :)

Easy to set up, no instructions needed. Might think about getting a bigger wireless pad.

B079KZ49PJ,R3H0V3GYH7XWA3,Not all that great,"Well I bought it with a specific intent. Saw a video of where a woodworker had carved out a slot for this type of a charger on bottom of a desk/night stand. I wanted to do same but before I even attempted it I tried putting a 1/4 inch plywood which is actually less than that and place iPhone 8 and iPhone X above the plywood and it would NOT CHARGE. Additionally, you CANNOT just place phone on top and expect a charge has to be in a specific position and light up (solid green) to ensure charge.

Also attempted to charge an iPad 5th gen, iPad mini, and iPad Pro just placing them on top of it in every position I could try but it would NOT CHARGE.",2
B07PPQGDVF,R3MGEEDTFAZ9EI,Great buy,Just received this product. It was nicely packaged and came in quickly. Everything seems to be in great working order. I am very pleased with this purchase.,5
B07P54F2JH,R2DJNGS8A346W5,Finicky but it works,"I wouldn't purchase these again but since I have them, I use them.

With the flat circle:
- you have to reposition your phone a couple times in order for it to start charging
- the circle gets very warm after charging for a while -- not dangerous but a little surprising

With the angled stand:
- you have to reposition your phone, take it off and on again, and then start charging
- the green light on the base will flash a LOT so don't keep it in a bedroom or other area that needs to stay dark",3

I’ve already thrown all the packaging away, too, so I can’t return it.

B0872QFB34,RMH3BT4MY4DIB,"Works Great - Just ""Plug & Play"" - But Instructions Could Be More Clear","I purchased this for my i-phone XR that was having intermittent problems staying connected during battery charging. Since I diagnosed that it was internal connection problem and not a cord problem (I tried multiple cords), I thought a charging pad would be an alternative to costly cellphone repairs or a new cellphone. The Amazon Basics worked perfectly on the first try. But the instructions could be clearer. It took me a few minutes to understand that a ""green light"" meant that the unit had identified my i-phone and that it did not indicate a problem. After a few seconds, that green light turned to a ""pulsing blue"" which indicated that charging was taking place. I am very pleased with this purchase. It has ended my frustration and difficulties trying to plug in my i-phone directly with a connecting cord.",5
B09NLM7JB1,RT7KQ7LK2UPZF,Anyone know how to utilize the warranty?,I have only had this for a few months and it stopped working completely. It was $50 and that is ridiculous.

B084G2RH1C,R9M14EIY3TLKI,Nice option for charging multiple things at one time,I have a collection of battery operated motion activated lights. I have them in my home so when we get up to go to the bathroom at night we have lighting but dont have to worry about turning anything on or off. This charger is the perfect solution to charge these lights at one time. The cord is shorter but for me that is perfect because I have this charger on my kitchen counter and it is plugged directly into the wall so a longer cord would be a pain and get in the way. The outlets do have a blue light that lets you know your plugged in and charging. Its not very bright. I dont mind the glow of light at night either way so it works well for me. So far this charging station is a great buy and works well in my household.,5

El único problema es que tengo que comprar un cable nuevo para el Apple Watch porque el cable con el que vino mi Apple Watch está larguísimo y creo que para este producto necesitas unos más cortos.,4
B07J2KMP4X,R1DS5UL2KAY623,Not a big deal.,"I got this stand having high expectations, because I love Google products and because it is very expensive. It turns out, it's just a wireless charging stand. I have Google home mini and use GA on that and my phone, the charger didn't really enhance that experience. There weren't really any features that justify the price. Returning for a $20 wireless charging stand from another brand. Value for money gets one star.

Four stars for charging power. Very good in that respect. Left one star off because the stand doesn't charge quite as fast as the plug that came with my pixel 4xl.

Five stars for traveling, because the construction is simple and sturdy.

I wanted to be all about this charging stand, but it just isn't worth the money in my opinion. Most I'd pay for this is $40 because it's from Google.",3

B08JY8BH95,RYX2C74S3J5OT,Charges thru hard case AND pop socket!,"I think I may be late to the wireless charging game but better late than never. This device is amazing! A friend at work let me try it before buying it. I have a hard case and pop socket on my phone and the charge still works. I was truly surprised. Later the same day one of our office tech guys let me try his wireless charger (different brand) and it did not work. I knew I was buying Tozo.

No more fumbling to plug in my phone at night before bed. Gone are the days where I thought my cord was fully plugged in but it was just shy of connecting. I haven’t “loved” a product as much as this in a long time. It borders on being magical!",5
B0915C1ZRT,RQ95MSAIWVB9L,Great product,Product was very simple to use out of the box. The ability to charge my phone and earpods is a great convenience. The ability for this device to fold flat for easy portability makes it a nice complement to my tech gear.,5

B09NZQFY22,R2SBJP6EPPAOWU,"Great product, could use some features","This is a great product that charges your devices efficiently and elegantly. The device was able to charge my iPhone 12 Pro from 20 to 100 percent in roughly 12 hours. Note that when charging multiple devices at once, charge rate on each device is thoroughly decreased. I was able to charge my phone, AirPods, and Apple Watch together on this stand for the night and woke up to all devices fully charged. The LED indicator is nice, but seems to only turn green when the phone has finished charging. I enjoy the ability to turn the light off.

There are some things the manufacturer could improve on in the next iteration. If AirPods are placed slightly off of the charging area, they will either not charge at all or at a painfully slow rate. Adding a recess where the charging coils are would be a great improvement. I have 3D printed a small cradle and placed this on the device to mimic such a feature. Next, the MagSafe connector for the phone is fixed at one angle, making it hard to see the device when placed at or above your head height if on a nightstand. Having an adjustable angle for this would be great.

Overall, 4/5 product for its value. There are definitely higher quality charging products available, but for the device’s specs, looks, and value it is a great value.

NOTE: This device did not work with non-MagSafe cases throughout testing! Keep in mind that without this style of case, your device will need to be removed from it’s case before charging.

Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and how it charges my phone and other items.",5
B09PGBDP66,R3K8WD59LHH63V,Awesome product,"The product is of great quality and for the price you can’t go wrong, it charges my iPhone fast and the good part I have a charger at home at work and in a travel bag.",5
B07DC2MJR4,RUJV6WM7J3XD0,Worked great but not any more,"Delivery was not as fast as I would like but it is a great product when I first received it. About 15 days later, it didn't charge. Thinking I didn't have it cradled correctly, I took it off and charged it else where. Since then, it needs to be unplugged and replugged everytime even though the blue indicator light is on. It will even be green indicating it is charging but it isn't. It also doesn't charge fast.",4
B0769JN5MG,R3A8A8U2W4B3WT,Decent charger,Nice charger with green LED indicator. The cradle is a little bit difficult to engage charging. You have to place it just right - a little wobbly- other than that a good deal- quick shipping,3
B00YRYS4T4,RTFMW5O97GX2I,Five Stars,Item arrived as advertised. Works great,5
B086KXY2RK,R32C4NK3P74GB5,Does not work for me,"Never had a wireless phone charger so getting a try.
After a while I realized that its not working for me. I have to really be careful with how to position the phone on the top of the counter . It has to be a specific place, and when it connected there’s a light that will be turn on. There’s a couple times, When I get my iPhone in the morning and it’s not being fully charged. I think it’s much easier to just go back to the classic one. :)",2

B01K9MQ8WW,R37HEN7TFUKIBH,Works great. The LEDs aren't super bright so at night ...,"Dual quick port car charger. Got this for my wife because her car charger didn't support the quick charge stuff.

I've bought at least eight chargers (home, work, cars, gifts, etc.) and everything works great.",5

B07DC2MJR4,R32WBIC4OSX9GH,"Great product, works as advertised","Product is great, working fast. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because you can't change the angle of the phone, which you would expect from a product which is on the higher price range.",4
B089G6RM6Z,RS0DLDKNAR072,Best 3 in 1 charger I have used so far,"This is the third wireless charger that I have gotten and so far this one does everything right. Its very easy to travel with because its foldable and it comes with a built in apple watch charger. All the other chargers Ive had required the original apple watch charger to be installed to the charger. In this product, it comes with it! I was also concerned that the hinges were not going to be sturdy enough but I was wrong. The stand is very stable and does not bend easily. The matte feeling is premium as well. I would definitely recommend this charger to anyone how has multiple devices that charge wirelessly.",5
B09KS115G9,R3RKI9FZQRBXJE,It is nice to have all in one spot,I only have one cord to charge the phone and watch,5

B07V7W1TK9,R3F2ZEGYYN95SX,Good Product With A Few Minor Flaws,"I received the Hoidokly charger stand in the mail a few days ago and have been using it since. It works well, and has some nice charging indicator lights on the bottom. It has a decent build quality and setup was pretty self explanatory. It has two parts, one for AirPods or AirPods Pro as well as Apple Watch, and then one with the phone wireless charger. It is powered by usb-c and the two parts connect via a magnetic set of power pins. The main thing I like is the design. All the cables are hidden inside the device, so you only have one cable plugged into the wall that works for all of the devices(the usb-c cable). Now to the things I think could be improved on. Sometimes when moving the device, since the two parts connect magnetically, they magnetics come off. This could easily be fixed with stronger magnets. Second, when adding my Apple Watch cable, since the cable is pretty long, it was difficult to fit it inside the device. Maybe they could provide a short Apple Watch cable with the device? That would be nice. Third, The watch is kind of inconvenient to set on the stand and take off because there is kind of a huge thing above it with your AirPods. But overall, the product is good. It has a few flaws, but I think its worth the price.",4

B00YRYS4T4,R2HJM4QU39E4NJ,Excellent of its kind,"I purchased this multi-port USB charger to use while on a cruise ship whose cabins provide few outlets. Typically, I need to charge four or five devices overnight and most ships, and even hotel rooms, do not provide a sufficient number of outlets. Moreover, the charger allows me not to have to carry individual plug in chargers. I have found Anker products well designed and durable.",5

B09B7FKV8Q,R11RZH758GLUHT,Great combo charger,This is a great charger. The reviews regarding the bright lights are accurate. It’s on my night stand and flashes all night long while it’s charging. It’s the type of light that disrupts sleep. Cool design but all that light isn’t needed. I’m just going to tape most of it off with black tape. Otherwise I’d give it 5 stars. Great for travel too.,4

It clips on magnetically to my phone, displays the % of charge and then quickly charges my phone. I had another wireless charger, but it would not always charge my iPhone 12 properly. This automatically connects and it is just worry free. Great charger for the price and the best thing it comes with the 20w adapter to give ""fast"" charging capability. Great product.",5
B09N1HJZCM,R3JLJH5DV3P1Q3,Sostiene muy bien el MagSafe y es cómoda de usar.,"Me gusta mucho como luce mi teléfono suspendido en esa base. Es muy cómodo de tener en el escritorio. Con el ángulo que tiene Face ID trabaja muy bien y con solo voltear puedo ver las notificaciones que llegan. Si se tiene un teclado Bluetooth, este soporte es buen accesorio para suspender el teléfono a un ángulo y altura cómodo para teclear y ver.

El aluminio se siente muy bien, sólido y bien trabajado. Hasta parece oficial de Apple.

El único contra es que si retiras el teléfono con cierta velocidad puedes retirar junto con el el MagSafe, pero se puede resolver con cierta costumbre.",5
B07MHZQ2NQ,R27IZLQTOAMADT,Fast charging!,Great plugs for fast charging. Bought the 3 pack cause I always needed to charge iPhone and iPad at same time! Then my grandson needed to plug in his iPhone so the 3 pack was a good choice for us.,5

Once it's connected it does the job.

I don't think I'll travel with this...too many things to squeeze in bag. Use a cord and wall socket.",5
B08VMX6GXQ,RD5IT02Q4FWM,Not up to par,"Really wanted to like this item, so I made sure I had some time of use before writing the review. I use the phone careless, so the issues other brought up about being without a case isn't a problem for me. With that said...the magnetic holding force isn't that strong even without a case. The phone would still sometimes fall off the mount when the car goes over bumps. The charging is OK. Speed is OK. advertised at 15W (?) charging but its still much slower than charging with a cable; it more so maintains the same level or charge rather than charge the phone.

Overall I can't recommend this product to anyone. Not until the holding force is fixed.",2

B07QVL8ZXW,R2RM5EF1SADDQP,Garbage and a possible fire hazard,"Ok, I get that it is a cheap product and you get what you pay for but out of the three things you get only one worked. One cord was completely dead, the charger itself heated up so much that it was almost too hot to touch with bare hands and I was a chef (seriously a fire risk). That left me with one cord that hasn’t broken yet. So $15 bucks for one cord. Yeah, I should have known better, it is garbage.",1
B08S3ZFG5S,R3HV4TNKH1PGYR,"Great length, but...","Yes it works, just as designed.

My only gripe is the lack of flexibility because I can't remove it from the wall charger and plug it onto my computer for data transfer, that's what earns it the ""but...""

B074Q3TN8L,R3LM0KQZ6SE4HB,So far it’s good.,So far it’s been working decent. For some reason it struggles to charge my Apple Watch 3 series. No matter if it’s plugged in 3.0 slot or not. Which is weird because my iPhone 10s charges just great.,4

B07MTSYXSC,R25XW67X21EUB4,Extremely slow charging,It was delivered quickly and it's easy to use but other than that I wouldn't recommend it. I put my new Galaxy S22 on the charger at 8am 24% & woke up at 1130 and it was only at 90%. I'm super disappointed 😞 I have a thin clear case on my phone so it shouldn't be an issue. I don't see why they advertise it as a fast charger when it's slow as it is.,2
B07QVL8ZXW,R177U6E4Z1UNOP,I wish I bought more!!!,"In my experience these cords charge fast. I bought the 6' cord and think it's just right.

B09N982NDT,R2ICHLXACK319R,Very convenient,"I use this for my Apple watch, iPhone 11, and Airpods Pro. It has no issues charging all 3 at the same time. The best thing is it only uses 1 cord. Other 4-in-1 or 3-in-1 will tell you to attach YOUR OWN watch charger to the device so you have 2 cords. This also comes with the required charging block. Others will give you the cord but you have to provide a charging block that may not even work with it.
Overall, a great value!",5

I did not see the note at the bottom of the description that says ""this is not a power converter"". Had I seen that I would not have purchased this item. It is absolutely useless to have this item NOT BE a power converter as well. Since the power in the country it was to be used requires converting from 240 to 110 so I don't destroy my cell phone.

B0769JN5MG,R2IIMMYND6PAN7,Good thing it was cheap,"I got this on Prime Day or I would probably go thru the effort to return. That said its no unusable but some flaws.

1: the USB C charging cable was DOA out of the box, fortunately I had some spares.
2: The Phone site quite vertical, doesn't take much to knock it off the cradle,
3. The base and Cradle are quite narrow, contributing to problem 2.
4. Tough to interact with the phone at all while in the cradle as even a swipe might knock it out of the cradle.

IF the whole thing were just a couple cm wider. and the rake angle of the charging plate were reduced even 5 degrees shallower the product would be more usable.

It was cheap enough to not go thru the effort of a refund but probably would not by another.",3

B08JYH992T,R34FF71US8HWBL,Wireless charger,"I’ve had this wireless charger for about two months and I use it approximately every other night to charge my iPhone 11 Pro. It can’t get much easier than setting your phone on a disk — no more fishing for cables or trying to plug in the phone in the dark. The light it emits is pretty bright in a dim room, so on charging nights I set my phone so it covers the lights, and on non-charging nights I simply flip the disk over so the light won’t bother me. The charger generally works consistently, although I’ve learned to verify that the phone recognizes the charge before I go to sleep. (Once in a while, the phone doesn’t seem to recognize that it’s on a charger despite being solidly centered; I don’t know whether that’s an issue with the phone or the charger, but picking up the phone and setting it back down on the disk usually corrects the issue.)

Overall I’m very happy with the charger. It’s attractive, minimalist, and of sturdy quality. However, I knocked off one star because the company emailed me after purchase to offer a free second charger if I write a five-star review. To put it mildly, I was disappointed to receive such an email. I really don’t appreciate a company trying to buy five star reviews in exchange for free product. I wish they would let the charger stand on its own merit because it’s a great product and I would have given it five stars.",4

B07MTSYXSC,R1YYDT515FFJJH,Works ok but not as good as original wired charger!,"I just got this thing today several hours ago and so far I'm somewhat impressed, kinda happy that I bought it and it's worth the money I think because I've had my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 phone for a few years now and my battery doesn't work nearly as good as it used to because I'm constantly charging it all the time and it runs down real quick but lately my charging port on the bottom of my phone sadly basically became unusable so no matter what cord or charger I use it hardly charges up at all and that's so incredibly irritating because it just won't make good contact anymore and it's just constantly draining most of the time even when I have it plugged in so I researched what I could possibly do and I thought about actually ordering another battery and charging port both and trying to install them both myself but it looks a little bit difficult and I was worried that I might permanently damage my phone even more if I try that and I still might I'm not sure because I would like to have a newer charging port as well as a new battery no doubt about it honestly and extend the life of my phone even more without getting another new expensive Samsung phone again soon even though eventually fairly soon I will have to get a new one as always just like everyone does every couple or few years but I saw this thing here on Amazon and it got pretty good reviews so I figured I would try it even though I never felt confident that these wireless chargers actually worked but I figured it's worth trying and I'm glad that I ordered it because so far it's working somewhat and you can even lay your phone sideways and have it charge wirelessly sideways also in case you're watching a video or something so you don't have to have it upright all the time which is really cool but it really does save your charging port and I wish I knew about this thing a long time ago and I wish I had faith in them when I heard about them before my phome got so old and messed up but I never thought they worked at all without actually plugging something into your phone and I thought these things were just a gimmick like with a lot of things and they might be somewhat but at least so far this thing is working somewhat even though it does seem to charge slow compared to when my phone was newer with the original plug in charger but I think that's possibly most likely due to my old phone with the old battery really because it is charging and it's extending the life of my phone so that I can continue to use this phone and keep it for a while longer but it doesn't charge fast enough if I actually have the data on or if I'm watching a video because it will still drain down but just not as fast as if I didn't have it on this thing so that's a big dissappoontment, it really only will charge up my phone completely if I'm not using my phone at all and if I have my data off which is better than nothing so it works ok and it's saving my charging port on the bottom of my phone because when you're constantly plugging your phone in and unplugging it for years even though I thought I was careful it really wears out the port on the bottom of your phone over time just like with anything and charging it wirelessly is saving your port and not wearing it out but the original charging way does work a lot better but just not on my phone anymore sadly because it got damaged and my phone and battery are both really old now sadly so I wish I got this sooner before my phone got so old and damaged to see of it would work even better but it does work some but not as good as a wired charger on an undamaged and newer phone for sure!",3

I put one near my computer and one in the bedroom, and my phone hardly ever drops below 60% now. Super convenient and a great price.

I wanted to secure it under my desk rather than on the floor so I didn’t have wires dangling from the desk to the box. It was a little challenging getting the lid to shut and stay put (possibly because I had a lot in there: a dell laptop charger, macbook laptop charger, desk lamp cord, monitor cord, standing desk cord and a 3 socket extension bar). After securing it with velcro strips to the bottom of the desk, I had to use some extra tape/velcro to seal the lid because it kept popping off. Overall great product and it makes my workspace look so neat.",4
B08RD23N46,R15P2JYIUXNC47,Love this! So compact yet so powerful too,It is very compact and folds down flat. But don’t let the size for you because it charged my phone AirPods Pro and Apple Watch all at the same time within 90 minutes.,5

B07L9QST54,R2WRA261PXHKLC,Easy to install,"These are easy to install with basic tools. You will need about 3"" behind the face to install and wire. If you're adding to a new circuit you will want to add a fuse around 10a or so if this is the only thing on there. Beware if you wire this straight to battery it will end up killing your battery if left sitting. If you want to wire to turn off with ignition you will want to add a off road lighting style relay. The trigger wire is connected to your ignition source to turn relay on and off. Then relay is wired straight to battery. That is the proper way to wire additional loads to your ignition. Don't splice into your ignition circuit and power these extra loads. The circuits were never designed to handle it.
Now the more technical aspects these are QC port and will quickly charge your fast charge devices up to 18w also. There's also fast charging 15w WIRELESS chargers that work well. But check the specs make sure it's 15w.",4

It has performed flawlessly and at this point I don't know how we kept our devices charged without it. That it adjusts the power based on the device is brilliant. The warranty is excellent and I appreciate that the company contacts their customers with a follow-up email ensuring support if problems develop. First class all around.,5

Of course wireless charging isn't as fast as a wired connection but it is slowly creeping up there in the previous years of advancement. The profile is slim and does not take up much space at all.

B09MT26FSP,RGBZMROWSCVJW,Stopped working after just 1 day (Horrible seller),"Bought this for traveling because of the foldable design. Got it just one day before a trip so I took it along with my regular watch charger. Good thing I did. The charging stand worked great the first day, charging all my devices at once to 100%. The watch charger is magnetic, like my OEM charger, which was great. However, after just 1 day I tried to charge my watch and the watch charger did not work. Tried the phone and earbid charger and they were dead also. I plugged my OEM watch charger into the USB plug adapter and it worked. Then I plugged the USB cable that came with this charger into the adapter and then into my phone and it charged just fine. So it has to be the charging stand itself. The LED light and USB charging port didn't work either. It is sad because I really wanted this to work. There aren't any other folding designs out there I like. I am returning this.

UPDATE: After posting my review, the seller has repeatedly emailed me, offering me up to $50 to remove my negative review. Now I know why this item has so many positive reviews!! I would never buy this item again. Too bad because I can't find any other travel charger that folds flat.",1

It was very difficult to get a USB plug into the charger. You had to force the plug it. Then, when you tried to take it out, the entire charger would come out of the socket. Then, once it came out of the socket, it took two hands to get the USB out of the charger. Even using both hands, you could not get the USB plug out of the charger and still keep the charger in the socket. I returned it and bought another brand.",1

B00YRYS4T4,RZ5V4E49DIFE,I simplified my charging life.,Perfect. I had USB outlets built into my kitchen walls. Didn't like the clutter it caused and they were only 1 amp. Picked this up and was pleasantly surprised how a small it was. Plugged about 8 iOS devices and a couple Bluetooth headsets in and they all charged extremely quickly. I used a watt meter on it and it did a great job switching to trickle charge on the devices that no longer needed a rapid charge. I picked up a few 6 inch lightning cables to keep the charging station clutter free. So much better than before.,5

For the record my watch will charge on any other charger I have or have used. Save your money this is a waste!!!! As a charging platform it does not work, but it does make for a nice stand, that it does well sitting there looking sharp and holding stuff....just not actually charging anything.",1

Sometimes, taking it off and putting it down again -- so much so that I wonder why I didn't just save time and plug it in. Not with this one. Put it anyone on the pad and instantly (not the lag I have with some others) it starts charging. The lag is important, because during that time you're wondering whether the phone is on right and is charging, so you're just standing there, waiting for the phone to indicate it's charging. This one's great.",5

I am not disappointed in the slightest. While it might seem like a bit of a silly thing, not having to physically plug in your phone at the end of a long day really is a nice touch. This item comes with an extra long cord and adapter to plug into the wall outlet.

I have noticed that you should double check that your phone is positioned correctly on the disc to ensure it is actually charging. This device charges my Galaxy S6 without any issues, even through the Otterbox Commuter case I use.",5

You have to place the phone in a certain position for it to charge (which is a bit of the ledge where it’s supposed to fit). While a great concept was very disappointed. I ended up throwing it out because after having it for 2 weeks. My phone would barely charge on it,2

Between three dogs, our cat, and my poor placement decisions, this charger has been put through hell. It’s been yanked out of the wall countless times by wrestling dogs, and the only way I can tell is that the prongs have bent just a bit. On top of daily wear and tear, this charger frequently gets tossed into bags for travel. It still looks nice, and it still charges quickly and reliably (given decent cables of course).

They are shipping me new items. I don't know if this will solve the problem, but I do think Anker deserves credit for reaching out to me proactively to try to solve my problem. I will update again once I have received the new product and tested it. I changed from 2 stars to 3 stars in recognition of their great customer support.

It seems like a well made charger, but it does not appear to deliver 2.4 amps per port (8 amps max) as advertised. I have a Garmin GPS that requires at least 2.0 amps tp charge, and it reports insufficient current from the Anker hub to charge. I have another USB charger that is specified to deliver 1.8 amps and the Garmin charges OK on that with no issues, so I do not believe that I am getting even 1.8 amps from this device. Note, I have 2 of these and they both exhibit the same issue. If you don't need the full 2.4 amps, this seems like a decent charger, but at least in my case, it does not charge a device that requires 2.0 amps.",3
B07KFS6RQQ,RGL0OAO5JXW8M,great product! fast shipping!,this brand is among my favorites. super reliable and very durable. fast charge and can charge both our phones and my tablet at the same time. great buy!,5
B09KZMN957,R17711O8JQNU68,Great charger,"Great little charger. It charges fast, connects easily and doesn’t take up a ton of space. We liked it so much that we bought a second one. The cord is a little on the short side, otherwise would have given it 5 stars. Great product.",4
B086SM2KWH,RCJC9UOZOBLUX,Works good. Makes weird beeping noise.,"I want to love this charger. I like most everything about it. However, when my phone isn't on it there is this light beeping noise. I seriously thought I was losing my mind. My husband can't even necessarily hear it on his side of the bed but it is definitely there. He did come listen and confirm I'm not crazy. LOL.",3

B082X6N8PD,R2FGJPCP9CKKRG,It's awesome!,"Originally purchased a cheaper one. Did NOT work very well. Purchased this one and everything worked great. Check out the diagram (included) to route the wires in the unit. As long as you do that install should be a breeze and takes about 5 min. iWatch 5 and iPhone Xs work is what I use on it, but probably compatible with multiple devices. I don't have earpods yet, but if I get them it's compatible with them too.",5
B08PNW423Q,R3ND5O5DBFI986,Funktioniert,"Das Ladegerät funktioniert wie beschrieben (in meinem Fall mit dem iPhone 12 mini). Lediglich die Verarbeitung ist verbesserungswürdig.

B086WDHCVV,RVM79QHXQ3NRW,Does not work,I purchased this charger for my wife’s iPhone Iwatch and AirPods Pro and the only thing that charges is the iPhone. By the way this is the second one I purchased I had to return the first one because it didn’t charge anything. I thought I got a dud the first time so I just replace the order for the exact same one. At least this time the phone did charge.,1
B07T8TRBNQ,R3UXUZ90Y8LMAE,Awesome charger,Damn good charger. It charges my iPhone XS super fast. I plan on ordering a second one to bring with me on the go.,5

B0734RKVLT,R2M1287H1RU9TD,Charger feels really hot,This charges our devices slower than the other bases we own. It also feels really hot when you unplug it from the wall. This is a brand I will be avoiding in the future.,2
B098QC58J9,R29YGXV8STIUVY,It works!,"This thing looks cool on my desk, and charges my three devices at once. It charges my phone very fast, but neither my watch nor my airpods charge very fast on it, even on their own. And my airpods case is a bit thick to charge wirelessly on this device, so watch out for that.
Still a great and good looking product.
When it turns on it flashes three colors, but in use there's only the blue for charging and green for on. I like the teal you see when it turns on, which I could switch one of the colors.",4

I have purchased cheaper products in the past that proved to be very unreliable. The Anker chargers are proven quality products, very satisfied.",5
B07DFWKBF7,R1LHUTYKDYKVL6,"Great Little Phone Charger, iPad not so much","Picked this up while looking for a new charger. This has a great size and is slightly bigger in all dimensions from Apple's 5W charger that ships with iPhone 6s Plus. Doesn't block up the other outlets on your wall either which makes it nice. This charger will charge two iPhone 6s Plus at the same time, but don't count on it to charge your phone and iPad at the same time. It will give your iPad a little boost, but will not charge it up fully. For phones, it works great. Also used it to charge up a couple of rechargeable flashlights. Is small and compact which makes it nice for travel. Like having the little extra port over Apple's 5w standard charger which makes it nice while traveling to charge other items. If you're looking for a phone charger, this one is tough to beat.",4
B01MR9DBRQ,R38YDZXT7I84PN,Perfect in all respects.,Worked great. Had port for charging cables. Didn’t need a special converter.,5

B07DCH7KM5,RXJICQB7AFODX,Stopped working,Had these about 2 months now. They don’t work any more. Too late to return. Money down the toilet.,1
B0845N4JMT,R3H83K7ZMEWOGO,Disappointed- Nice Design but Wireless charging flaky,"I liked the modular design and appearance to tidy up a messy charging area but the wireless charging was flaky with my iPhone SE. When it worked, it worked great, but about 20% of the time, it wouldn’t charge the phone without my power resetting the charger - seems to be a recurring issue in other reviews that I had read but discounted. (Apple sells a white version of the same charger which I took to be a reasonable endorsement.) The problem persisted with or without a case on the phone and fussing with placement on the pad made no difference. When not working, the charger just did nothing - no light, no charging - but occasionally it would flash a red error light. I’d need to unplug the power cord to restore operation. In every instance, I was able to validate the phone’s wireless charging using another wireless charger I have, with no issues. Maybe a defective unit, maybe some odd compatibility issue - in any case my patience ran out after a few days and I returned the unit. Still gave it two stars for innovative modular design and the USB corded stand worked well for my iPads.",2

B09B7FKV8Q,R3SNI1K2PHTA4O,I do really love this,"This a great product. It let you charge all of your Apple products at once and looks really nice.

The only thing to be aware of is that the airpods must be turned backwards to charge. I thought it didn't work at first. I presume this is so the light doesn't shine when you don't want it to.

Awesome product!",5
B09B37BG8Z,R3C6OX8B22L30N,Works well through case!,"I recently got an iPhone 13 pro along with this charger and a Smartish case. I bought the Smartish after researching the different ""tough"" cases out there and I love it. I was worried however that a magnetic charger might not work through the case (it's thick) but this one works perfectly and holds on really well. It also seems well made, solid, and I love that it can function as a stand. Overall a great product!",5

B08CXZQ1N1,R22U923RPP6WMW,The Best Charging Hub for the Money!!!!,"This has to be the best charging hub you can buy for the money. I have owned a couple of other ones that I liked, but I could never find one that could also charge my iPad Pro 12.9. The ones I have found cost about a couple hundred dollars which I don’t think I want to pay for that nor any one does. This thing works beautifully. I like how the watch charges on the ground unlike hanging in the air like some of the other ones I have had. Sometimes it wouldn’t sit right and didn’t charge which would suck waking up to a dead watch. I love that I can place my iPad Pro, Brydge keyboard, and Magic Mouse in the dividers. All charging at once. Now the only thing I don’t like is that it comes with three cables to charge your devices lighting cable, USB type C, and a micro USB. I had to use one of my own type c to charge the Brydge keyboard. That would be the only thing I didn’t like about this hub. Other then that I love this charging hub. I would recommend this to anyone that has multiple devices to charge.",5
B00VH8ENXE,R18FCTP8NIQ9QK,So nice to be able to charge 4 things at once.,"Love having 4 outputs all in the same place for phones, tablets, etc. Its charges our stuff quickly and haven't had any issues with it being able to charge anything I have plugged into it.

I would give it 5 stars if it had been a little less expensive but even with the cost the quality and functionality was worth it.",4

B098Q7K6XZ,R4A2W67HELTVS,OEM performance at a greatly discounted price,"I bought this charging power adapter to pair with a wireless charging stand (I was previously using the OEM Apple power adapter). I have noticed very similar charging performances with no issues. I've also tried to pair this adapter with the standard Apple charging cable (USB-C to Lightning) with no issues as well. The Yootech charger feels very solid and well-made.

At the time of this review, the official Apple 20W power adapter is selling for $19.00 on Amazon. While this Yootech power adapter is $7.99 ($12.99 without coupon). The value of this charger is apparent, especially with very similar charging performances. This could make a good daily charger or a cheap travel charger.",5

B07XXDS86V,R2IW8ZZDCN550E,Gets HOT!,Bought to charge 10 iPads. 6 at a time was all it could do. 7 overloaded. Even charging 6 at a time took long and it got HOT! Never charged more than a few hours and by 3rd day started to melt and I could smell burning. It MIGHT work for 1 or 2 at a time but for a 10 port outlet not worth the large device. It gets HOTTTTT!!!!,1

B0795D7KBD,R32N19N7ZMIIHT,Poor connection?,"I’m editing my review purely for the excellent customer service I received in regard to this item. The company reached out to me and offered a full refund as a result of my issues with it. I still can’t give 5 stars because i don’t know if other products work or have the same problem, but I’m just assuming I got a bad charger.

I had way too much trouble trying to get this charger to work. The other car chargers I own work just fine in my car but with this one I had to wiggle it and twist and turn it to try to get a solid connection to charge my phone. I didn’t just try once and give up, I got it to work twice and after that nothing. It’s not worth the hassle.",3
B07DC2MJR4,R4DAKE2IMGUKU,Recommend for Galaxy S10+,"I purchased this charger for my desk at work because I stream music all day which is killer be on the battery.
It's worth it to spend the extra few dollars for the cord and plug in. I have a very similar wireless charger that's a different brand but I didn't realize it didn't come with it's own cord and plug. The (other brand) charger itself relies on the correct type of plug in order to be a fast charger. So it was a hassle to find the correct hardware.
The Nanami wireless charger came with cord and plug && is a true fast charger. Faster than any cord I've used. I've noticed that my phone gets kind of warm when charging but Im charging while streaming which makes my phone hot regardless of what I'm charging with.
The quality is a lot higher than I expected. It doesn't look or feel like a $20 charger.
The only thing I dislike about the charger is the light that remains on while it is plugged in. The light is blue when nothing is charging and green while something is charging. I understand why the color light is there but for me personally, I wouldn't be able to sleep with the constant light if I were to put it next to my bed. My old charger turns green when connected also but the light goes off after 60 seconds. The light is of no bother while I'm at my work desk. I appreciate that I may lay my phone horizontal and still charge. Overall I really like this charger and I'd highly recommend!",5

B07V4DB1Q8,RBYWQTWRNQUEG,Slim & Portable! Fast charging.,"The charger is sleek and slim and therefore very portable. I like it because it doesn't take up desk space due to its low profile and thus far it seems to be charging quite well. I have other wireless chargers, but this one is my favorite because of it's slim, space-age look and portability.",5
B09F64GZQN,R1CAGO9KZPTXBM,Easy to use,Bought this as a gift. They were pleased with it and works as it should. I felt great value for the price.,5
B0795D7KBD,RU89HYMSC2JSK,"Great Charger, Would Buy Again","Works great. Solid metal construction that feels like it will be with me for years to come. Sticks out a bit in my 2013 Ford Taurus, so if you have a Taurus from 2010-present I’d recommend getting the slightly shorter one. I find it convenient because my Police Interceptor socket never turns off, so the little edge sticking out makes it easier for me to grip and remove it every time I exit the car. It has a very dim blue glow that I don’t notice at all until I’m getting out of my car, which reminds me to unplug it.",5

B082X6N8PD,RRM3NVGSAD41I,3 in 1,"LIkes:

1) Saves cables and space.
2) Can take calls without worrying about charging.
3) Can watch videos in horizontal mode and still charge the phone.
4) AirPods lightning charger protection.
5) Beautiful glowing blue light to show when charging is on and static green light when devices are not charging.

Dislikes:

1) USB to USB-C Cable should have been longer.
2) Initial setting up of Apple Watch wire takes little time.",5

I took this charger on a long trip and was pleasantly surprised at how fast it charged my phone. I didn’t have to leave for for long periods of time it was charged and ready for action because this description was TRUE! It FULLY charged my phone in about an hour.,5
B01N2HIR9R,R2EVVWR3V3ZC20,My wife loved it till it stopped working,"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife last Christmas but she reported it stopped working starting November of this year. Tried using various USB cables but it won't charge her iPhone 9 anymore. It used to zip and charge my Samsung s8 so quickly. None of the ports work anymore.

Such a shame because we loved using this product until it went kaput.

Anker can you replace this item please? I've read there's an 18 month warranty so I'm still within that window.",4

B09MZ8JP3B,R2SCIBUYTT7VYX,Charge keeps cutting out,"I bought this after my original one that looked the same but of a different brand had gotten ripped off the dash by mechanics. (Anyway) It was working fine up until a few weeks ago when the arm of it kept sagging no matter how tight I tightened it. The magnet on it is great, however it has started to be extremely difficult to get it to connect to charge my phone. I’ve tried with and without my case and some times it will connect and immediately disconnect. It’s almost like there is a sweet spot I have to hit for it to charge.",3
B08DQ6C5J3,R258DVGMONN47C,Really convinient but don't expect super fast charging,"I really like to be able to charge multiple devices ( I have an S21 Ultra, WF1000XM4 and Watch Active 2).

B01MRLECNF,R3T80FF6V5Q0IW,"Returned!! #6 USB didn’t work, very cheaply made and dangerous!!","I had ordered this to use for multiple Apple devices we have! Straight from the box was easy to plug in, but was very cheap and reminded me of something I could have bought for $5 somewhere, but def not $23.

I pulled it out of the box, and the bottom USB was not working. I went back into Amazon to see if it was even worth trying to return or just make due with the one broken port!! Luckily I read a lot of reviews from people from recently about how the plastic is melting or the phones are melting, so I returned it ASAP and bought a more traditional safe good old fashion surge protector one with USBs, USBCs and basic plugs",1
B08L5M9BTJ,R2AHPKDN0IXQ4U,Fast iphone 11 charger,"I am glad that I purchased this charger. It was much faster than the charger that came with my iphone 11. Within one hour, my phone went from 7% charged to almost 100% charged. That was fantastic.",5
B01IUTIUEA,R1DPMIKQT2BYUW,"Great for traveling, 2 iQ QC3 ports, Anker brand, long power cable = Another slam dunk from Anker!","Ok, so my review may be a bit biased because I have begun to trust Anker so much to the point I am almost exclusively using Anker products for all my cables and chargers, with the exception of the few OEM quick chargers and cables I still have laying around. After using this charger for 2 months, I think I have tested it enough to give a solid review on the charger. I currently have 3 Anker iQ QC3 car chargers, 8 6ft braided cables and just added this 5-Port charger into the mix. I picked this up because I was growing tired of tying up most outlets on a 7-plug powerstrip, that and I had a destination wedding to attend out of the country and didn't want to worry about packing several chargers and a powerstrip. With this single device, I was not only able to keep my devices charged, but also any of my friend's devices when they stopped by my room. While I never ran tests using special tools to measure the output of the 2 iQ QC3, I am very aware of how long it takes to charge my QC3 compatible devices using the OEM charger and both the iQ QC3 charge ports on this device charge my QC3 compatible devices in the same amount of time.

Pros:
- 5 ports, 2 of which are iQ QC3 charge ports
- As far as I can tell, the 2 iQ QC3 charge ports charge at the same rate as my OEM QC3 chargers
- Only uses one plug to charge 5 devices, vs needing a powerstrip
- Lightweight, but durable
- Power cable detaches from charger for easier packing when traveling
- Power cable for charger is long, I believe it is about 6ft in length (haven't measured it)

Cons:
- Can't really think of any...",5

B07YBV3P8W,RQ3SDNDCZPCAG,These were so worth the money!,We bought this because my husband's charging port quit working and it has definitely worked wonders!,5
B07V3B5SRW,R26D3R82TE9LY3,Overheats - fire hazard,The other reviews are right - this thing can totally overheat. First it stopped fast charging and became a super slow charger. Then I started smelling burning and took it out and it was super super hot. Another reviewer wrote that this even caused a fire. It probably would have if I hadn't unplugged it. STAY AWAY!! I'm going to get an original samsung charger now.,1
B06XXZK99F,R3UJD7VL0445FW,Wish it worked more of the time,"Originally I loved this charger. Would charge my Samsung Galaxy s20 plus very quickly while holding it in a useful position. For whatever reason it has become very finicky to charge or not charge, I have to prop the plug in with something to get it to turn on. The charger also did not work with my spigen phone cover. It is getting very hard to try to use this thing now",2

B07TBLHKHG,R1FG4MFZVFLFC9,Perfect for my Note 9,Really wanted to find a charger comparable to the original that came with my phone.. This was the perfect option that I found with no bad reviews that was fast charging for my Note 9.. So glad I got this,5
B07THHQMHM,R2HFZQWY2NAM4K,Great product! Good price!,I have had this since February of 2020 and it works great! It charges pretty quickly and through my case that I have on my phone. I have a iPhone 11. It has a small blue light that lights up when it is charging the phone. I keep it next to my bedside so I can charge my phone at night while I’m sleeping and the light doesn’t brother me. It has to be lined up a certain way on the pad for it to charge the phone properly. I think it’s priced pretty good too.,5

The holder does hold my iPhone firmly, never falls, I won't buy any traditional holder anymore - It is super easy to attach the phone on the holder. The thing that I like it most is - it looks handsome. Most of the holders are ugly, or very big. This one is small, neat.

I love this product :)",5

B0794WT57Y,R32DQWRCIY7B4P,Sigh...didn't last,"Over the course of six months the USB plugs became loose fitting. Thought I was charging when I wasn't!

B07WYCJLS7,R3GT9TDLSI98DT,Don't metal in my stuff,"You can not have any metal on the phone case so if you have a case that has metal, it will throw off the connection.

B08FJD9CB7,RIAEG4HTSQ8HL,Phone charger not very reliable,"To charge the iphone12 mini, it required very precise placement - and any little bump would dislodge the phone from its position and it would stop charging. The apple watch and headphone chargers work great.",2

B00YRYS4T4,R1HQLA2RQOK9V,"10 ports from Anker, look no further","My husband started randomly buying Anker products after reading some reviews and doing research on different speakers and headphones. We loved the speaker we got his mom so much, we've purchased others as gifts. We loved the wireless headsets we have from Anker so much, there may be some people on our gift list who will share a similar appreciation by Christmas. This port is no exception to the quality we now expect and trust from Anker. Having 10 ports is also super practical when you have countless devices needing charged. Little secret, we started with the 6 port and expanded on Prime Day. I highly recommend the 10 port if you have a lot of devices you're trying to charge simultaneously. I love the efficiency with which this port charges everything as well. I also value that in edition to making quality products, Anker makes affordable products. If you're in the market for a USB hub, look no further.",5

B082XDGK8J,R39BGPG73DCTYL,Works for my Pixel 3,"The USB connector on the bottom of my Pixel 3 has started to go bad. Became increasingly difficult to charge my phone at night. Decided to get this charger instead as it does not use the connector. Been using it over night for a week and have been very happy. When I go to bed at night, the phone is <20% and when I wake up its at 100%.

The phone appears to also pick up the charge though the case as well. However, I do not normally charge it that way. Overall, I'm very happy with it. Only downside I have so far is that it is easy for the phone to slip out of the charger when I first put it down. The base it sits on is small and easy for it fall off if I'm not paying attention. Even easier in the middle of the night when it's dark.

I'm very happy with it and am considering getting a second one for my office.",4

B07TTGPPBF,R3JUPIR0EO7BIE,Great slim port wall charger,This is a good wall charger with a usb-c and usb3 ports. The slim profile is ideal for bed-side charging. The only downside is the prongs on the wall charge dont slide in when not it use and is an awkward size to pack in a travel/dopp bag.,5

Auch die Ladeleistung über USB und USB-C ist nicht zu beanstanden. Klare Kaufempfehlung!! 👍🏻",5
B08FG5LJN3,R3RDO490BEFVQ4,I LOVE this charger,I'm obsessed with this charger. The quality is amazing for the price. I have an apple 11 and I have no issues with overheating like some of the other reviews have stated. Maybe it's a battery type/brand thing? But it's super minimalistic and doesn't take much space. It's a quick charge too. My other favorite feature is it's angled perfectly to where I can just raise my head up for my phone to unlock to check notifications in the middle of the night. 10/10 reccommend.,5

If you do not place your phone exactly right on this and check the red Satan's eyes on it to ensure proper placement, it will not charge. If, however, you do ensure Satan's eyes have twinkled, you will have a fast, full throated charge. Now I acquired this free from Samsung when I got the new S22, a phone which goes through its battery so quickly I could use it to warm my hands and pockets if I actually needed that. So I really need a charger that will replenish a rapidly discharging phone, repeatedly. This charger will train you to make absolutely certain you align exactly, or else you get nothing. The combination of the S22 and this design is making me consider a jump to the dreaded iPhone and I have been a Samsung Galaxy user since their start. So beware before buying.",1

Works great on those devices even with cases on! I just got a new iPhone 12 Pro Max. If I have it on the charging stand in normal vertical portrait orientation it won't charge. If I turn it sideways to landscape orientation it won't charge. However, if I turn it upside down into an inverted portrait orientation, then it will charge my new iPhone 12 Pro Max. Maybe my new phone is too tall for this stand? Weird.",4

B07H4M4N5V,RWHV13S6A9Z2G,Best Car charger for USB-C / USB,Dual ports make this useful when I either need a quick charge to my iPhone or if someone else happens to hop in my vehicle and I don't want them using the USB ports in my car since they auto-connect the passenger's phone to Apple Carplay or the Google equivalent. Super fast charging using the USB-C port and I believe the regular USB port supports quickcharge so it's 18 or 12W which beats any standard 5W charger you'll find out of most other car chargers.,5
B083J1T7CC,R3EJJYPCAINKCZ,CHARGER,It seems that it may be a little faster charging than my 5 and 9 watt devices but not by a huge difference. The multiple ports are a nice feature and the multiple ports helps clean up my charging area.,4

This charger actually got much LESS use than what a car charger would normally get from me, because, due to COVID, I haven’t driven nearly as much over the last seven months.

B09PV1H4XR,R16S6D30R9ZSLT,Works Seamlessly with All My Devices,"I was having issues with cords on my nightstand to charge all my electronics at the end of the night. I had separate cords for my Apple Watch, iPhone, and my AirPods. So I wanted to clean up the cords, and I'm glad I found this 3 in 1 charger that works seamlessly with all my products. I noticed that some of these chargers require you to buy a power brick separately, but this one comes with one. Great value. Highly recommend.

Apple Watch
I have a Series 3- 38mm Apple Watch. Once my watch is recognized by the charging station (took a little jostling at first), it charges fast and stays connected. The charging plate is a little larger than my watch so that could be leading to some of the issues.

iPhone
The iPhone jack has an adjustable depth to the backing so my phone fits seamlessly while still in its Otterbox case. I will say that the silicone protector piece for the charge port can get in the way at times but that's more a problem with the case than the charger itself. The charger works perfectly and allows for quick charging.

AirPods
The AirPod charging jack works perfectly for my regular AirPod case (2nd Gen). No issues at all.

All three ports work seamlessly together to charge my devices at the same time. I am very impressed with this 3 in 1 charger and it is exactly what I've been looking for for my nightstand. No more cords. It's clean and sleek.",5

B0797F2V5C,R223TC7Q1SKQVW,Charger stops charging at approximately 95%,"I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The fast charge works fine untl battery charge is at about 95%. The charge then stops and does not resume. After testing, I have determined that somehow the case I am using (Otterbox) is what is causing the problem. If i take the case off, the phone charges non-stop until the battery is 100% charged. That being said, I had an off-brand charger before this one and it charged just fine with the case on, however it was not a fast charger. The fact that this one is supposedly a ""genuine"" Samsung charger, I would expect better performance. Furthermore, if you move the phone ever so slightly, the charge stops, so it is almost impossible to use while it is charging. I give it 3 stars because I bought it since my USB charging port is not reliably charging my phone anymore, so in that respect this charger fulfills my needs. Other than that, there is nothing spectacular about this wireless charger.",3

Over the period of 1 hour or so, my iphone charged around 10%, an hour of charging my airpod pros was also approximately 10%. Not only that, both my iphone (charging without a case), and my airpods got very warm when it was charging that 10% in an hour. On top of that, last night I places my iphone flat on the charger, and the blue light lit up. The next morning when I woke up, my phone battery was at 20%, and my phone, again was very warm, which cannot be good for the phone. I don’t know how it could’ve just not charged over night, but this indicates that the charging can be highly unstable.

B09LQZM4ML,R19VNX9SW0KYZW,Excellent,"This really is a cut above most of the cheap magnetic car mounts I have tried.

It has a robust metal housing in a colour very close to Apple Space Grey, and a clear front showing the very neat layout of electronics inside. The clip mechanism which attaches to an air vent vane is very strong, even without the locking ring that most such brackets use to clamp down - this one just attached with a squeeze, and I couldn't pull it off without fearing the air vent would give first! Similarly, the magnets attach it very securely to my iPhone 13 mini, and the fold-out supporting foot which braces it against the dash works well to keep it from wobbling.

The only slight snag is that it uses USB-C for charging - most car adaptors are still the older USB-A type, so you will need a new power adaptor or a USB-C to USB-A convertor; that said, most modern cars are starting to come with USB-C, so this problem will go away over time.

But that's about all I can fault it for - this will be my go-to phone mount in the car from now on.",5

Small caveat, when charging the lights on front that indicate charging do not have a sleep mode. (they do not turn off) I saw that most premium wireless chargers have that feature. However it’s not a deal breaker to me ... and again the only con, to me.

My son wanted to carry a single charger for his laptop using USB-C Power Delivery, and other devices via a regular USB-A port. And I wanted the charger to be safety tested (e.g. UL or ETL listed). I have found and bought 2 similar chargers that do this:

1. Bluefeel USB C Charger PD 45W Charger Power Delivery, model S-TR-141
https://smile.amazon.com/Charger-Delivery-Dynamic-Detect-MacBook/dp/B09DW6P8ZY/
(10/16/21 updated the Amazon link; old link was dead; Bluefeel product appears the same but now no reviews are shown)
Pros (compared to the other charger):
*Economical (only about half the price)

2. This Amazon Basics 68W Two-Port GaN Wall Charger, model B087MDT515 (update 10/15/21: this product appears to be gone from Amazon)
Pros (compared to other charger):
*More powerful (rated 60W max if only the USB-C port is used, 3 Amps at 20 Volts)
*Has an LED that tells you if it's plugged into a live outlet
*Made in Vietnam (an advantage if you think we should diversify our suppliers away from that other country we have a huge trade deficit with)

Both chargers:
*Are UL listed (for safety)
*Get only slightly warm to the touch when in use, ~20 degrees F above ambient temperature
*Can charge a HP EliteBook x360 1030 G2 laptop
*Can charge a HP Elitebook 850 G6 laptop
*Can charge an Apple MacBook Pro 13"" 2017 model (added to updated review 5 Apr 2021)
*Are versatile with both USB-A and USB-C charging ports
*Travel well with a plug that folds flat, and can operate off 100-240 VAC

Charging the most power-hungry laptop I have, the Elitebook 850 G6 (with a 15"" screen), using a USB power meter in-line I have seen the Bluefeel provide 2.05 A at 20 V (41W, ~5W short of it max rating), and the Basics 68W charge at 2.75 A at 20 V (55W, also 5W short of it's max rating). In both cases the chargers could recharge a depleted battery while the laptop was in use, though obviously the Basics should be able to recharge it faster with it's higher power output.

Note the Elitebook 850 G6 comes with a 65 Watt non-USB charger, but the Bluefeel 45 W USB-C charger was able to power it just fine.

If you plug into the USB-A port to charge a phone, I've seen the Basics 68W USB-C output drop about 0.5 A (~10 W) from 2.75 A to about 2.25 A. This is expected as the back of the charger shows two sets of specs: one for 2 outputs in use, USB C and A, and another spec for only 1 output in use, USB C.

I recommend both of these chargers. The Bluefeel costs a lot less and is fine if you don't have a very power hungry laptop (if you're not sure of your power needs, you could buy the Bluefeel and return it if it can't charge your laptop). The Amazon Basics 68 W may be better if money is no object and you need to have a higher power charger.

I urge everyone to only buy electronics that plug into the wall if their SAFETY has been tested by a reputable lab, e.g. products that are UL or ETL listed. Any design flaw in something connected to 120 VAC could turn it into a fire hazard.

I used a USB-C to USB-C 3 Amp (""60 W"") 6' fast charging cable that I purchased separately.

I will not rate a good product over 4 stars unless I've used it a long time, so if the Basics 68W still works well in a year or two I'll try to bump the rating up to 5 stars. P.S. I'm an electrical engineer.",4

B0894TL5JG,R1C8Y4S9GZ26JW,S21 Ultra,This is not a FAST CHARGER for the S21 Ultra. I've had the charger for a few days now and the first time I put the phone on the charger it said fast charge 1 hour until full. But seconds later it changed to say charging 3 hours until full. I had a Samsung wireless charger that was fast charge that I gave to someone because I thought this one would be better due to the watch combo. No! I'm returning this immediately and will use a plug in charger until the new Samsung wireless charger comes in. I regret buying this.,1
B09KTZ4LX7,R1MW6X57S63RR9,This charger is super!,"I put this charger on my bedside table to charge my phone, I watch and AirPods and it is just what I wanted!",5
B07MCVBP7N,R509UYYRKAK5V,Definitely a useful purchase,"I had accidentally broken or lost a few of my charging cables, and even burnt out one of the wall mounts I had. I ordered these as I was in a desperate need for a charger, and they're amazing! The cords seem to be quite durable, they charge ""lightning fast"" as would my normal Samsung charger, and they're super long which is really convenient! Definitely glad I bought these and recommend them to others looking for decent, lightning-fast, and long android chargers.",5
B07C3PV1PX,R3W28FVEJCNO2Z,Fast and works great,"Fast delivery , works great. Thank you",5
B09PGBDP66,R25OQTR9TQQDFO,Worth the money spent and Charges our phones perfectly!,We needed Charging blocks for both our IPhone 12 Pro Max. I found these and they are perfect. They work super well and perfect for traveling. Would buy again!,5

I tried to contact support with no luck",1
B0711MR47S,R280SNMQHG8Q7A,Great magnetic charger!,I can’t believe how easy it is to snap this onto my iPhone. I got it to see how great it would be and decided to test for a few days to see if anything would come up. I’m happy to report that there are no issues and I don’t even have to look to properly set my phone down! I just move my phone into the area that I left the charger and it snaps right on and I can go on doing stuff on my phone while it charges or set the phone down and let it charge. It even works on iPhones that don’t have the magnetic charging but it does not stick to it from what I’ve seen. At this point for older iPhones it seems to just be a wireless charger. Other than that I love the product.,5
B0769JN5MG,R1S28WDOECEETK,WORKS GREAT NOW,"Put my phone on this while working and realized I was at 1% battery. With green charging light turning off, you can't tell your phone isn't charging unless you watch your battery. Very bad! Very disappointing!
UPDATE: After adjusted the cord and charger this is now a wonderful charger. More secure than post ones and quick charging. Edit to my prior disappointmenting review, this is a wonderful charger. I recommend and would buy again!",1
B08XXR25TF,R2A9VPKVVZ3G92,"Excellent charger, as good as OEM","Purchased this after my wife complained about not having enough chargers for all our iPads. Works as well as the original Apple charger, charges quickly and has plenty of cord length. A good solid charger for your Apple devices.",5

B07N682SWY,R8E2NBATSYK31,Quit working after a month,Worked really well for a month. It just quit working right outside of the return window. I have had other chargers from them and didn't have a lot of issues but this one is just kinda crappy I guess.v,1

B07FM8R7J1,RIFNILDAUROF7,Great charger with great aesthetics,"This is my first time entering the wireless charging world as I just got a new phone that can accept it. So I saw this one and figured it would be a nice looking one to go for. I’ve had it maybe a month now and so far so good! Of course it charges slower than plugging it up but the low profile gives it a sleek look and feels closer to feeling like I’m just sitting the phone on my nightstand. I’ve noticed other wireless chargers don’t stay lit at all times, this one does and I’m seeing that to be a benefit, because at night when I’m searching for the device, it’s nice to spot the little green semi-circles in the dark so I know where to line the phone up to, then the semi-circles change to blue. Neither color is too bright to sleep beside. Also I’ve noticed that when I accidentally give it a static shock, apparently there’s an internal safety measure that resets the device as if I just plugged it in the wall. So that’s good to know a simple static shock won’t kill it. Overall good purchase, I do recommend!",5
B07GPJP8ZC,R1JOGOOG1JDTNJ,Love both chargers!,Love that this comes with two different chargers! I love the stand up one next to my bed and have the flat one at work! Both charge my phone well and I don’t have to worry about faulty charging cords!,5

The results are clear - it's making a whistling rattle when charging! Does it sound safe to you when your charger is whistling at you? Well, me neither!

It looks very shiny, too, which is a nice bonus. I'm not a huge fan of the lights being on constantly, as opposed to only briefly when devices are placed for charging, but it just means this isn't a night time bedroom wireless charger. I already have another one for that, so no big loss, but it still seems wasteful. Overall a good purchase when on sale.",5

B082SV1NF1,R30L0DKLTS80RG,It worked okay for about a year then stopped.,"The set up was alright, and it worked okay for about a year.. then all of a sudden it stopped charging continuously. It now loses connection every couple of seconds- both the watch charger and the wireless pad. So when I place the phone and/or watch on, it charges for a second then stops for a second then charges and on and on. That can’t be good for the devices. So basically, it’s of no use now. It’s a simple charging pad and should last more than a year, particularly given that the watch charger was my own (which works fine used on its own).

I typically rely on Anker for chargers and cables, but this was sadly a letdown.",2

B07WV1J8QL,R1EZWBCMLU2QYB,Tolles Qi Pad fürs iPhone 11,"Ich benutze schon einige Zeit dieses Anker Qi Pad für mein großes iPhone 11 (gekauft für 20€).

Zuvor hatte ich einen induktiven Ständer, aber auf diesem rutschte das große Handy immer nach vorne und stand auch nicht 100-prozentig gut. Daher suchte ich eine induktive Ladematte zum Darauflegen. Das hat auch den Vorteil, dass man beim Laden weiter arbeiten kann, Während das Gerät auf der Matte liegt.

Dieses Pad hat genau die richtige Größe. Sie stimmt genau mit den Abmessungen des iPhone 11 überein.

Das Handy liegt sicher auf, weil es durch einen Ring am Verrutschen gehindert wird. Mein Telefon wird mit 7,5 W schnellaufgeladen.. Wichtig war mir auch, dass das Modell Qi-zertifiziert ist.

ich bin sehr zufrieden mit diesem Ladepad und empfehle es gerne weiter. mein Mann benutzt es auch gerne für Sie ein kleineres iPhone 8 und seine induktive Ohrhörerbox.",5

B07VSMK849,R1JTHE8090LQLV,The best charging block I’ve purchased yet.,The best charging block I’ve purchased yet. Just so that people don’t get confused this is not something that holds its own battery power. Rather this is something that outputs a larger amount of power through the block than normal Apple adapters or other plug-in phone adapters at Cetera will use. I would say it has enough power to charge a laptop and iPad Pro and an iPhone current generation presuming you have the max with a pro with a max pro or whatever they’re called nowadays so that everything Requires a good deal of power. Every time I put plug something into this to charge it charge is much faster than anything else I have. And I actually bought this because I saw a Kickstarter or an Indica go for a similar product so I did a search and sure enough here it is on Amazon already made by anchor so I’m very happy with the product and I use it almost every single day and I also like to travel with us because it’s so powerful and it’s got just enough ports for what I need.,5

I don’t have to worry about plugging in a wire to my phone and if overtime it would rip or tear causing charging issues.

B07WYCJLS7,RSUM3GFOK78BK,Average wireless charger but not if you have a thick case,"I wanted to get a slow wireless charger for my Pixel 5 and at first I couldn't get it to work properly. While it is doing what it's supposed to now, I don't know how it happened or why it fixed itself. I have heard that thicker cases aren't compatible with some wireless chargers but the Unicorn Beetle case I have on my Pixel 5 still charges. Ditto.

One issue I do have is it doesn't come with an actual power brick, only the cable. It's kinda understandable that some companies want to eliminate E-waste but since this is a charger, it's headscratching why one wasn't included.

All in all, it's a perfectly good charger aside from the wonkiness of trying to get it to work at first. Nothing too special or fancy but it's fine.",3

A+","I just put my iPhone (with or without the case) on this charger and--as is true with all Anker chargers I have used--it charges quickly, safely, and even quite elegantly. I use it for FaceTime & conference calls. I have it sitting on my bedside table in the picture, but it looks just as good & works just as well on my desk. As for the price, which is not cheap, my feeling is that if you can afford an iPhone, you can't afford not to have a name-brand charger. Anker is that name, in my opinion.",5
B07WYCJLS7,R2CCZN3C6WA4WN,Not great,"I’m using this with an iPhone XR. It’s inconsistent at best.

It’s best used for a desktop charger. I wouldn’t depend on this to charge a phone overnight. Half the time I set my phone on the base and a LED shows it’s charging but then I awake to a dead phone and missed my alarm.

***UPDATE***
Anker's customer service is top-notch. When they heard of my troubles they shipped me a replacement model quickly and it works great.",5

B07CBJTYN8,R2ACRGIU4NVZIJ,These are great. They are difficult to find for a Samsung J7 2015.,Originally I ordered only one which was working great...until my cat chewed it...lol.

B09PYHS59Z,R25LFFU1K49NQ7,Great charger to keep on nightstand or desk,This is a great charger for me to keep on my nightstand. It's not a fast charger like my corded one that came with my phone. But it's nice to not have to deal with the cord when I want to quickly grab my phone and do stuff. I have a pop-socket so that hinders the charging so I have to take my phone case off at night to charge it. When my battery is almost dead this charger takes about 3 hours to charge it back up.

B0894WLWL7,R22T8XQL7VUML0,What I've been looking for,"This charging station is just the thing I needed to charge my Samsung phone and watch. First it was hard to find a Qi charger that will allow charging with my Otterbox case on. Then having 2 chargers was a little hassle since I travel a bit. Most of charging stations similar to this seemed to only gear towards iphone products or wouldn't allow charging with a case.
For those with Samsung products, I highly recommend this Innovative Wireless charging station. It works beautifully",5

B077XS5LSD,ROM9TGUX6KO8W,Sturdy and performs perfectly.,There is nothing to dislike about this product. It works exactly as I expected it would. The wall adapter is extremely sturdy and I expect it to last a long time. I have confidence in this supplier and would buy other products from them.,5
B075Q5731C,R18NV7SSB1C1WA,Works as promised. Everything charges & seems to be quicker. Slightly tippy...,"This is really a problem-solver for my family. I was running out of USB ports on my PC, where I usually charged Bluetooth headphones, MP3 player, etc. not to mention another power strip crowded with chargers for multiple devices. We've been using it for about 3 days and it does seem to noticeably increase charging speed over the devices' original chargers, besides providing more USB charging ports.

The charger is very lightweight (so it would be easy to travel with!) but that makes it somewhat prone to tipping over when it has 3-4 devices connected to it, although that doesn't seem to affect its functioning. Admittedly, it is not yet situated in the best location in our apartment -- I put it on our dining table in the entry/foyer to test it out, and family members have been frequently plugging in and removing devices. This tendency to tip would likely be helped by a) finding a more out of the way location with adequate space for the plugged in devices, and b) reeling in the charging cords to more consistent, shorter, lengths to avoid a spaghetti tangle.

Some older reviews (2017) mention an LED light that came on when it was powered, and I think that was also mentioned in the instructions included with the product. However, it must have been removed from the current version of the product. There is also no on/off switch on this unit, so to avoid vampire power draw, it should be unplugged when not in use. Because of this, I think the LED would actually be a useful feature so it would be clear when the charger is powered or not and avoid the annoyance of plugging something in for charging and later realizing it wasn't charged...",5

I have not had the phone slip forward as other have had but I watch the phone accept the wireless charge before I walk away. Once you put the phone in the stand it takes about 1 second for the phone to accept the wireless charge. As long as you wait for that to happen then you should not have to worry about it slipping forward and dropping the charge. Like I said though I have yet to have it slip forward and not work correctly.

I use this charger with a case ""Galaxy S7 Edge Case, Caseology® [Envoy Series] Premium Leather Bumper Cover [Carbon Fiber Black] Leather Bound Bumper Cover for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016) - Carbon Fiber Black"" and it works fine. I turned off the fast charger since the case I have has a leather back insert and I did not want to heat it up to much. Otherwise the normal speed wireless charge is fine even with the case on.

B077XQJ2FK,R1PGXMSN87HDNB,Slightly Noisy,When plugged in the unit puts out a very high pitched sound. Similar to a pest deterent device. Can only hear it when close but still not a typical sound coming from a charger. The unit works and price was right so I am going to keep it.,4

B07D64QLQ1,RNPXLY3NLKDW1,INCREDIBLE Value!,"This charger is amazing! At only $20 this is an absolute steal! I use this to charge my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9), my laptop (HP Spectre X360 15), and anything else I have on the go (I'm trying to convert all my things over to USB C)
PROS:
- Tiny
- Very lightweight
- Stays VERY cool during charging (Stays cooler than the laptop charger that came with my laptop. Not only that, but the laptop also stays cooler, which is essential in ensuring the longevity of your device)
- Delivers the promised amount of power
- Incredibly travel friendly
CONS:
- The cord is pretty short. It's longer than my phone charger cord, but it's shorter than my laptop charger (the charger that came with my laptop is a 90W barrel plug. Overall, it's a 10 ft cord). I have my original laptop charger and a wireless charger for my phone at my desk, but when I'm on the go I use this 65W USB C charger. It's something to consider if your outlet is more than 4 feet from the couch. I think though most places I've had to travel so far, I've been able to find a place with a close outlet, but it's been a little inconvenient. If you do consider getting a longer cord, make sure you get one that supports 65W or more. There's several good 10' ones on Amazon for only about $12
- Not really a con because I knew this when I bought it, but the cord doesn't support fast data transfer speeds. It was made for power delivery, not for transferring files. It can double as a data cord (if you have 2 USB C devices) but you won't be transferring anything very fast.

In conclusion, for only $20, this is an absolute steal. It's plenty small and light enough for me, it stays cooler than GaN chargers, and I can just leave this in my bag and forget about it and leave all my other chargers at home and still be able to stay plugged in on the go. It's really saved my back, not having to lug around the 3 lb brick my laptop came with. Another use case for this could even be with a USB C dock that supports power pass-through. If you're on the fence about getting a travel charger, just get this one",5

I always make sure before going to bed that the phone is on the charger correctly but sometimes wake up and the light is flashing and it’s not charging. Other times it takes multiple attempts to get it to sit in the charger correctly to actually make proper contact. It could be my case. I haven’t really fully investigated the issue but I like how it can charge my watch and AirPods at the same time.",3

Doesn’t take up too much space and it’s easy to use. My problem is the charging capabilities... not sure if I got a defective one (I’m replacing the one I have) but it takes FOREVER to charge and even then it never charges my iPhone 11 or my tozo wireless earbuds to 💯% ...some could argue ur iPhone or earbuds are old but they were both purchased this month. I love the fact that I can charge both items on this disk, but I’m sure other brands can do the same and charge faster and more effectively.

It does not charge very well and I have a android phone which it was advertised was compatible to all android and iphone cell phones (Galaxy phones also). The charger would charge my phone sometimes. One particular time I had put my phone on the charger at 13% and let it stay charged over night, it had only charged up to 19%. I was done with this product at that time.

After setting up magnetic wireless chargers in my cars I started looking for a wireless charger/stand for the iPhone and my Apple watch. After a few weeks of use I can say that this product is as close to perfect as you're likely to find. I chose the white color and it looks awesome on my nightstand. It comes with a high-amp power supply and has no problem charging the iPhone and Apple watch together. I just drop the phone on the stand and hang the watch from the upper part just before bed, then awaken to both devices charged and ready for the day. Gone are the days of forgetting to charge one or the other device, or forgetting to take my phone to the bedroom at night (important safety habit). Looks good, works great, no issues whatsoever.

B08CV9V743,R3U36Z6E1K07D6,Only charges momentarily.,"I love the length of this cable! But for my IPad Pro the cable constantly begins charging then stops charging.

The first one had a a failure at the USB C port on the product and would not stay connected. The second one stopped charging the watch after about a week. The third one would not keep the flashing blue light off. I would press the button to turn it off, then it would come back on within 5 minutes... Only solution would be to unplug it.... It does not charge as well when unplugged, as a heads up...

B08JLCXZYC,R1WO1TNQ746PGP,"Does the job, and with robust components","There are a lot of cheap chargers out there that claim to power 2x2.4A outlets. Many of them fail to deliver, or are trying to push too much power through cheap components or an overcrowded case. Delivering 24 watts creates a lot of heat, so while this may not be the smallest one out there, it has a lot going on inside, and will not overheat as a result.

The one thing I wish it had, hence a docked star on features, would be a folding or retractable plug. That said, the fixed plug makes it that much more sturdy, with one less thing to go wrong.

So far, it charges everything I've thrown at it at the rated power output (or what the device can handle).",5

B082GBHYVX,R29P2DZRUBPTJ3,Great charger and quite good customer service,I purchased this charger a few months ago and it worked very well. After a few months the middle charger started behaving weirdly and occasionally stopping a charge during the night. I submitted the request to Quezqa and received a reply right away.

B01N6WNZGP,R1QQSC83UJUEHW,Don't waste your money ! ! !,This is worthless . Within two months one did not work anymore. They are very cheaply made . The wires pullout of the connectors . The GSP plug is extremely bad. My kindle only holds a charge when plugged in and I'm using it. Charging take two days. The gdthing not even three months old. Don't waste your money I am never buying another one of these from Amazon again I bought three different charges through them and no more.,1

Great great product. Anker is always awesome with awesome support too!,5
B08K8DNVB4,R37KNIMLIORAPV,a true all in one for apple products,"A lot of the other chargers I looked at you would have to put your apple watch charger into the holder along with other cords sometimes. This is truly ALL in one. You do not need other cords or cables. You simply plug this one stand in and you can charge your phone, airpods, and apple watch at the same time. The light on the front is not too bright at night (when I charge my items) and does not keep me awake. It also lets you know you have the item in the right spot by coming on. This has worked great so far and reduced all the annoying cords I had by my bed. It would travel good too as it is pretty compact.",5
B09HQHJLSR,R2KDQ3Y15SKV8L,Stopped Working after 3 months,"The entire charger has stopped functioning. It no longer charges the phone, watch or airpods. I would not recommend this charger at all. It was a waste of $45. Very disappointed.",1

I have a Samsung galaxy note 5 and the only way as far as I can tell for the fast propriety charger is from samsung since it is not the quallcom proprietary quick and this charges almost as fast as the Samsung charger that came with it. Build quality is also better than I expected.,5
B07Y8T51VN,R32QMKGNT12EZ7,Shoddy and cheap,I am testing charging pads for a tech blog post I am writing. Ended up buying another products. Spend the same money and buy a better brand,1

B07WRKXQ8W,RTCYIC3BOQP49,Cheaper then the Apple Name Brand but with the same amount of power!,I love the smaller plug size just like the previous usb 3 apple wall plug! Makes it so much easier to store in any electronics case. And for less than half the price of the name brand Apple wall plug it’s well worth the purchase,5
B07G5T65JQ,R3Q83PKIJ7RU5F,Best Cell Phone Accessory Ever.,Purchased a Yootech wireless charger and loved it so much I bought another. So easy to charge your phone! Just set it on the stand and it instantly recognizes my Galaxy S9. Charges fast even through the case. No messing around with trying to insert the cable into the phone. Great charger!,5
B074QPBR95,R3RUEL1R5L2F6M,Works exactly as it states. Love it,Works really well. Used in back of car outlet as the front one stopped working. This allows one phone to charge in the back and two cords to be at the front of the car with everyone still being able to use their phones as they charge (large car). Great buy. Been used for 9 months and no issues.,5
B08JYH992T,R15RTA5RQQ4U4E,Slower Than a Lightning Cable,It seems slow to charge. I have the new iPhone XR. I am used to the speed of a lightning cable so I was surprised at how slow it is.,4

It fully charges my iPhone 13 mini in less than an hour. Plus, the color is cute and easier to find in my purse. I am going to buy more.",5
B09995P829,R2IRYTQBYCARWW,Powerful and neat,"I am really impressed by this little charging station! After being fed up by the pile of wires next to my bed constantly getting tangled and having to charge some of my gadgets on the floor due to the apple wires being so short, I was looking for a neater alternative.

This wireless charger works so well! It even works through quite a thick case on my iPhone and charges my iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods quickly and neatly. I like that it can double up as a stand when I’m working.

I was worried that the light would stay on all the time and disturb my sleep, but there’s a small button on the side to switch it off.

I’m planning to take it on holiday with me next week instead of having to pack 3+ cables as it’s small and compact.",5
B092D6ZYPP,R1CCJRNZ1JHVK7,Perfect for traveling or at the office!,This product was extremely useful! I bought it with the intentional of using it on the go and at my desk. I previously was using having to toggle between charging my phone and Airpods and then sometimes would end up mid-workout where my Airpods would die. This is the best purchase to have everything charge all at once so you don't have to fuss over any additional USB cables.,5

I tested the plug and the cable both, btw. It never was all that great to begin with. It charged her Samsung Galaxy S8+ and then her Samsung Galaxy 9 really slowly.",1
B08NCFN2H4,RH626MMW3LQHO,Great product for the price with a minor flaw,"I bought this charger for my iphone 13 and have been very satisfied on how fast it charges, even compared with direct connection. It’s very nicely made being very similar to Apple’s. Everything looks and feels high quality, and hopefully it lasts for a long time. It stays cool and can’t foresee having any issues. The minor issue is that with a case, mine being relatively thin, the magnet holds very weakly. Not sure if Apple’s is any different. I need to properly place the phone to assure the magnet will attach. For the price and quality I believe this product is a winner.",4

I have this at my bedside, so I just lay my phone on it, make sure I hear that the phone is charging, and go to sleep.

Once, when all my devices (phone, watch and AirPods) were being charged at the same time, my phone didn't fully charge and there was a red indicator on the charger.

B09C5RG6KV,R232PSAP285O4H,Results will vary when charging 3 devices at the same time.,"I really like the promise of charing 3 devices at the same time. This is a part of my travel pack and it reduce a lot of the ""bricks"" I carry. I wanted to charge, my iPhone 13 pro, my Apple Watch, and an iPad or sometimes my battery pack. What I found out is that when all three ports are used it doesn't alway auto switch and one of the devices will loose out on a charge. In my case, if I had my phone plugged in via USB-C and my battery pack using the other USB-C port, my watch wouldn't charge via the USB-A port. After working with Anker support it seems like its a known issue with this device combo.",3
B088KDLF19,R15RK448K7DKPD,"""super fast charges"" my Note 20 Ultra",2 super fast chargers and 2 usb C-C cables for 20 bucks? These look almost identical to the charger that came with the phone and appears to work the same.. They're prob cutting corners somewhere and i'm probably risking burning my house down or something but for this price it's too good to resist.. They're both working as expected 👍,5

Keeping it for convenience as it works great with my iphone 11.
Thought that I read that it worked without the cable once charged, but I don't think that's true. Not much instructions with it.",4
B08VF2C4Z9,R19UMJU6QP0U91,Just like the original,"I am not sure if this is actually the real OEM Apple charger or not. The cable came exactly the same way packaged as the original Apple. It really packaged, looks and charges like to Apple product for a great price.",5

B09C5RG6KV,R2717UUTY3DCGX,Great charger that is just a little too heavy,"So far this has been a great charger. The double USB-C ports with the USB-A port is a great configuration. Can easily charge three devices with no problem with the max output of 65W. If you want to carry one charger, this is the one to buy.

The only Con and this is a minor one - it is just a bit heavy compared to other chargers. However, the small size and usability of this charger more than makes up for the weight.",5
B09KH3Z9MF,R5DUFRKI0SF7I,This product works great!!!,"This product works great! In the past I have purchased something similar to charge all my apple accessories but it was not easy to use.

Warning that is not specific to this device but to all 120 volt AC (USA standard) devices you take on a trip.... I've heard of various accidents by USA folks traveling overseas with various 120 volt AC (USA) powered devices. These will not work (and are not advertised to work) in most of Europe and other countries without a POWER CONVERTER. Do not use these with just a power plug converter adapter since it will send 220 volts directly to your device - shock, fried device, or fire.",5

B079KZ49PJ,R4T1W2R6G0PAS,Works well on my iPhone!,"As long as I use my original iPad charger to plug it in, it works well with my IPhone 8. As stated by other’s and the company, it’s not as fast as with a direct cord but it’s a great alternative especially if you’re having any port issues or if you just want a cheap and reliable charger around. It worked right out of the box and I’ve had it for over a month. It does not work on any of my IPad models however, just my IPhone 8+. I use it downstairs as an intermittent charger throughout the day when my phone runs low or for guests who come over and stay and to use if their phone has the capability.
I was disappointed that neither of my IPads nor my children’s phone’s were able to be charged with the device as that would have made it an invaluable resource at my house & I would have purchased another.",5

B09GFFXVT3,R2EH96C205JDJJ,Watch charger does not work with iWatch 7,I thought this was a great product at first. Then two days after I started using it the watch charger quit working. I had a replacement sent and had the exact same problem. The company has contacted me and made me aware that the product does not work with the iWatch 7. So if you have an older version this product would be great for you.,4

B08DQ6C5J3,R2340TDTJBL3X1,Bad charger,"I had the old model that was charging only one phone. It was great.
Thought it is time to charge all of my gadgets on the same pad with fast charging.

After a couple of months the charger stopped working and only one pad still charging.
No warranty or any help.
I would recommend to buy a cheap third party charger instead of this one.
It was good at first. Didn't stayed alive long enough to justify its price.",2
B09V566QYD,R3DJYA4JTDMWJJ,Love that it uses USB C!,"I was pleased with how sturdy this charging stand is. It has a very easy to use locking system for the headphone stand portion. You just push it in and slide the tab to ""lock"". I love that it utilizes USB C for both the input and the output port. They even give you a USB C to USB A adapter. The wall plug is a fast charger 3.0 with a standard USB port. It charges both my Note 20 Ultra and Samsung Buds+ seamlessly, however it doesnt charge my Samsung Watch unfortunatly. But they dont advertise it to so I cant hate on that. I will use this at my work desk because it looks modern and sleek and I need somewhere to put my headphones.",5
B00UCZGS6S,R2FQIAQHG46WY6,I like the concept of this item but the charge is ...,"I like the concept of this item but the charge is really slow. Most of the time I just don't have all night to get a full charge. Plus one thing I didn't think about is you can't use your phone while it's charging. I plug the cord straight into my cell most of the time. In my opinion, it's not really worth the money. I should've sent it back.",3
B08M67RCGL,R3APG69IU4RUHV,Great value!,Great value for your money for an after market charger. I liked that the bricks that came with it has 2 USB ports so you can charge other things while charging your phone.,5
B08M3LNC6K,R4MQN0SO936QA,Great Product,"I bought this for one of my grandsons, mainly because when he stays with us he is always using mine. Once he used it, he is going to order another for his house. He was amazed at how fast his phone charged and was very pleased with the length. Anybody that has iPhone needs this charging cord, it works great and is longer than original.",5
B071WYF9HP,RNXASMRUIYI0C,Quality Fast charger,"Positives: Fast charging, USB & USB-C plugs, Led indicators.
Caveats: Costly, 80% as fast charging as a Galaxy Note 10 plus wall charger, no volt/amp/ indicator.",4
B088K6H3NM,REM6Y5EQAG2F9,Update review. At first it was great then...,"Now. The other day I noticed the changing brick was very hot in its usual outlet so I unplugged it to let it cool. It worked okay until this morning when it didn't want to charge. I finally got it to work and it began to alternate between fast and normal charging speeds. Not super pleased as it has only been a few months. Wish there was a way to reach the seller.

Aug 2021 Does the job. Fully charged in 30-45 minutes depending on the percentage before charge. My phone also holds the charge longer. Very pleased",5
B074Q3TN8L,R1Y8Q3ZOFKAKIG,Quick Charge Flakey,Quick Charge only works when I have something else plugged into the far right regular charge port. When nothing else is plugged in it charges for a couple of seconds then stops charging for a few seconds and the charges again - back and forth.,3

B09PYHS59Z,R3GY1HBCZVCRWU,Almost paid about 3x for same thing elsewhere,"It is a true first world problem: I don't want to have to plug in a cord to charge my phone!

So this doesn't cure disease or feed orphans, but it saves me a few seconds each time I use it.

I cannot comment on how fast it charges vs competitors or corded because, frankly, who cares? It's a phone not a heart pump. But you set your phone down and when you pick it up it is more charged than before. My wife's phone didn't seem to charge through her enormous case that I believe is made from some combination of led and whatever matter is inside of a black hole.

The local phone store had a competing product for about 3x the price of this.",5

B0995QL2LJ,R3USW4JJA562UT,Doesn’t charge ear buds,"This product does NOT charge the apple earbuds. Tried charging the case only, earbuds only, both together but nothing.

B07L9QST54,RBP2XZSF17PE6,It works,"Most importantly it works!!!
The wire harness worked great installed on my 2018 rzr 1000. Only bad thing to say is the wire terminals are fairly cheap while tightening my bolts back up on accessory panel one end broke so I had to replace it with a terminal of my own which was easy.",4
B08LVSFN4X,R2PC2JPINAE3J2,It charges fine,So I have several wireless chargers and this is about average. Don’t seem to charge faster than the others. The cord is shorter than my others but nothing too crazy. I do like the green light that shows when charging. And it charges with my phone in its case with no issue.,3
B07FBF2BNT,R3I2PIJ0D2N7JS,It works...it's only a charger!`,"It works. Plug things into it and it charges them. Can't think of much more to say. It didn't make my teeth whiter, and I still get weeds in my flower beds, but it charges my ear buds and iPhone just fine...all at the same time and I have one port to spare. Oh Yeah! That's why I bought it!",5

B01IPJX2NY,R3HW7LM1KTM7PF,"Charger is great, but I was shorted the cable then told the ad says only 1 cable, which is clearly not correct.","Charger is great, but the product page CLEARLY spelled out that it would come with both a USB to USB-MINI CABLE AND a USB to USB-C cable it only came with a USB to USB-MINI.

I did contact the seller, who promptly told me I was wrong and that it only has one cable. The following is a DIRECT copy off the page ""Package Contents:- Fast Charging USB CLA Adapter, Detachable Micro USB to USB Cable & USB-C to USB Cable. Charger Type:- Micro USB & USB-C with Fast Charging"".

The ONLY reason I did not sent them back (I ordered a pair) is due to the fact that the I do like the chargers themselves. That is also why I did not give a 5 star review.",3

I love that it charges my phone; I am a little concerned because the phone gets hot while it's on there charging, but so far no issues.",4
B01N68AMCU,RSP49DYJ4HBMY,disapointed only 2 AMPs,"Nice charger for the price. The only problem is if you wnat to chage 2 phones, you charge at 1 AMP or less. Twice the fast charge time. OK for overnite charging or no hurry.",3

B0746Y8C6H,R5V57EIX5G67R,"Dualx means two dual things, two high power USB outlets and dual use power for both vehicle 12V/24V and 120V prongs for home.","In 2012, I was on my way back from Lisle, Illinois (West of Chicago) where I worked for Navistar. I was just came down I-65 near where I hit US 30 near Merrillville, and head East towards Fort Wayne, when my fuel pump gave out. I have a flip phone someone gave me for a Christmas exchange in 2007 and it was down on battery life. Besides that it was difficult to hear with the big trucks zooming by on a nearly blind curve where my car had rolled to a stop on the Hwy shoulder. It was hot in the 90's, but I had to keep the windows shut so I could hear the phone's tiny speaker. I called AAA and was worried I'd run out of juice any minute, so I told them I'd be on standby and they could call me back when I could get a tow. Fortunately, my phone battery lasted me long enough to get help. I often run low on power with the phone during the week and if I forget to charge it before I drive home ( I still commute weekly, only now from Grand Haven, MI not Lisle ). This will be big help on the road, I sometimes talk with my brother or sister, with the flip phone being accessed through my Garmin GPS, speaker and microphone, and therefore hands free.

This also has another space to charge my Fire HD tablet so on the way back I have it ready for a full stream of movies and shows on Netflix and on Crunchyroll. Aside from the road there's a dual reason for calling this a Dual X, not only two charging ports for USB, but it takes two power sources, a 12V source from my Vehicle cigar lighter port, and a regular plug-in for use at the hotel, to keep my tablet and laptop charged. The plug-in prongs fold into the unit when not in use. Not to mention, on my night stand where it plugs in the lamp stand, it has a nice blue hued night light to see my meds and water bottle or find my cell phone in the dark. The price is fairly incredible for the double dual unit. Recommended, for those of us who travel and need an extra charging port to help with all our devices.",5

B094QR2BQL,R39BOSOZ0RC6C7,It’s ok,"It holds my iPhone 13 pro max ok, I have now used it on a 3 hour trip. I used it as a holder and had the phone plugged into the cars CarPlay.",4
B08Y8XD58C,R3GDZG741NY36K,Great product,Does exactly what we need. Lightning fast charging,5
B087WSPFBV,RJ35LWDPSBHNF,Honest review of the wireless charger,"Pros:
1. Easy to setup
2. Hides Apple Watch charger wire
3. Sturdy build quality
4. USB-C charging capability
5. One simple space for charging all your Apple products

Cons:
1. Space for Apple Watch charger is very small, so the space for the rest of my charger is cramped.
2. Apple Watch charger should be separately bought
3. The usb port and the usb-c port felt a bit smaller than the usb cable size so had to apply some strength to remove and insert the cables that sometimes I feared I might break it off.

In total I definitely loved the product and would recommend to people who are looking to reduce the wires and use a single socket to charge all your Apple products. Loved how there’s a separate Qi charger for and a lightning port for AirPods.",4
B071X6QR95,R1GLTRRJ0MXWPX,Bricks after a year and a half,I’ve had the blue and the green in regular use for a year and a half and they both just crapped out on me in the last couple of days. I guess $3 each for 18 months is a pretty good value.,3
B078LSG2DX,R39QM0DWMRXS0J,Nice,It looks nice but my other one you can see the light better on my other one from the side. This one you also need to position it well. The other you don’t. But this one looks nice.,4

B00E1UWA4O,R7FEADAG2CBFW,These are fantastic and allow for the fastest charging,I have ordered 2 of these now. One for my car and one for my wifes car. These are fantastic and allow for the fastest charging.,5
B072KBJN9Z,R1XFYK0JVVTVP6,Bought Three Times. Works Perfect and Looks Great.,"It charges all of our iPhones pretty fast. I bought two almost a year ago in the silver color option for our two family vehicles and had zero issues with them, and the shape of the charging port and the digital screen design is pretty nice looking.

I recently purchased a new vehicle and wanted another one of these and decided to go with red to match the dark orange trim of the vehicle. The color is beautiful and almost an absolute match with my ""Go-Mango!"" (Orange) 2006 Dodge Charger Daytona R/T.

Absolutely will purchase again for any new vehicle or even just to fill every cigarette lighter in the vehicles we currently own.

Update: Wrote this review May 18, 2019, and I'm writing this update June 1, 2021. They still work perfect, and one even survived a car wreck. Three years after buying the first two and two years after buying the third, still a great value.",5
B078LS9DY1,R3MQR182ZDRIFJ,Sleek design and highly portable,Love the rose gold color. It's thin and easily fits into my purse or pocket. I bought one in rose gold and one in space gray for my husband. I'm satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend! The charging power is decent and is comparable to most wireless chargers. I like these bc of their sleek design and portability.,5

B07THHQMHM,R3MK1EXOFPF8EJ,It works well in recharging iPhone.,"The wireless charging pad works flawlessly. I just plug in the plug and place the iPhone onto the pad for recharging. Initially, it seems to charge quickly before slowing down to 100%. I find the product works every time and the workmanship of the charger to be excellent. A very reasonable price and even better Amazon gives you a couple of dollars off. I would recommend and buy the charger.",5

B07TTGPPBF,R28B1Q97I954V6,Works Good But Tilts...,"Straight away the product does what its designed to do.
I gave it 4 stars because when you remove or install a cord in it, it wiggles around some or maybe flexes is a better term.
And, I don’t think anything should move around or flex in an electrical outlet when your handling it. My outlet is new so its not worn.
Its because the prongs are at one end of the square to not block the other half of the outlet so it just tilts some when you mess with the cords.

It works!",4
B093PPQK4N,RDLNZZ6SCFR6N,Works as well as the Apple brand,Received this quickly. It connects to my Iphone SE and charges reasonably fast.,5

B08PNW423Q,R2USX0MILBJUMM,Would 100% recommend! Very premium!,Probably my favourite accessory I have bought for my car! I didn’t realise how magnetic this would be and it would not let go of my phone after shaking it so hard! I honestly recommend this product so much! It charges very well too and the cable provided is a very good material. The black colour goes so well with black interior cars.,5

B07VYHPWWC,R1KYAM97MS0LH4,Great buy,I love this charger. I was looking for a phone charger that would charge my phone in a good amount of time while driving. This charger did not disappoint! I use it often. I would recommend buying it,5

B093FDLLKW,R205W8VPZM5LEV,Great phone mount for iPhone 12s or 13s,Very strong magnet and suction cup. This is one of the best phone mounts I’ve ever had.

B084G2RH1C,R2VEJR9TKXJX8B,Died,Did not last long. Sent it back.,1
B07WRKXQ8W,R3ML7OJ2HW7ZCX,Small,Much smaller than the Apple charger that came with my iPhone 11. Great to have a second charger with the USB-C port that can rapidly charge my phone. Lack of folding prongs but still very compact.,5
B00UCZGS6S,R3C07JKQLN7936,Good with one big annoyance,Works pretty well. Light is not too obtrusive if it's by your bedside. The most annoying part is that once your phone reaches 100% it will stop charging until you pick the phone up and put it back down again. Very frustrating if you put it down at 95% before bed and wake up with a battery life lower than that.,3
B08JY8BH95,R36RSQNIF2P1XB,Easy to use right out of the box,"i was able to open it right up and put my phone on it to test it out and it worked right out of the box. i will be using it on my bluetooth earbuds next after I have it charged up. the description does say fast charger, but my phone isn't fast charging, though this doesn't matter for me seeing that I will be using it for the earbuds.",5
B099F55CGR,R1O3P8QO2BR3E4,As advertised. Quick charger.,"Esthetically pleasant quick charger. Bought it as a present, ended up ordering one for my self, & will be ordering as a present fir few family members who have problems remembering to charge their phones.",5
B07MNY6MBB,R320XW8XUGJZKZ,So far so good,So far the car charger works great. It is a little testy when not turned a specific way but not a big deal it charges and does it quickly.,5

I had to such adapter, so I had to additionally buy this (or some similar adapter). My only other option would have been to plug it in and charge it with my Windows PC. I thought Apple products were known for great out of the box experiences? Mine was not.",2
B095NJXC1F,R3LMAVV3UWG6I3,Works Great,Hubby needed a new charging station and this covers all his electronic needs.,5

B0734SN6VR,RTLRXIGY2DH5F,How this shows up with good reviews is beyond me,"Don't buy! How this shows up with good reviews is beyond me. The USB holes are bent or too small and won't fit USB cord. Terrible, waste of money. Back to looking for a better product.",1
B00WIW42BQ,R2UXZMCSY2JGQN,Great for my home office,My partner and I have a lot of devices that need to be charged for both personal and professional use and we do not have a lot if outlets available to us in our apartment. This charging bay has solved our issue. I'm assuming this would also work well for a large family with many phones to charge.,5
B09L824FJL,R3VV2HGQ4N0OET,Poor Quality,"The soft rubber ring on the top of the charger started to come off after only a few weeks and has now completely fallen off. The charger is OK, but there are times when it just didn't charge the phone (even though the lights confirmed it was charging when it was placed on the charger). I bought two of these and only one has had the issues so far so maybe it was a fluke. I contacted the seller to see what could be done but they said they ""couldn't find my order"" even though I provided the exact Amazon order number. I would not buy from this company again.",2
B098362FW6,RRVB4PJARQUBC,Amazing chargers!!,These chargers are amazing!! They charge at a super fast speed and the cords are long enough to allow you to be far from the outlet. They are definitely a super deal for about half the price you’ll pay at an Apple store. I would definitely recommend these!,5
B07KKJLGZN,RPL7WRDNSOVG0,So close!,"So close! Works very well and slim to the wall. The ONLY issue is the power prongs do NOT fold. This means when travelling, it’s a tad awkward but hey, it’s a great bit of kit.",4
B08RHVBFSG,R1ROW6XZPQFXPM,Doesn't work.,"Out of the box this looked like it was a return sent out as new.
We placed a Samsung galaxy note 10 on it. It would not charge at all. Moved the phone around on the stand to find a good charging position and so no good. Then... put an iPhone 12 pro on it. Same thing. It's did start to charge the apple watch but would not charge the air pods and the phone. Its a really nice looking design. Would be better if it actually worked.

B07GPJP8ZC,RCQI8EXP12RHT,Fast Recharging!,This Device Exceeded what I thought I would be getting! Charges Fast and so Nice! Such a special price for the Flat and Upright Stand Charger. I kept the Upright Charger and gave the Flat Charger to my Grandson. It charges My S8 just as fast when I would use the Chord! A very Good Product! Cant Beet The Price Either! Each Comes with it's own Cord. The Cord it comes with fits a little better than the factory Cord.,5

B08PST1SZH,RV609GV08TG8W,Optisch schick aber kleine Mankos,"Leider fehlt im hinteren Bereich eine Aussparung für das Kabel der Apple Watch, sodass das Gerät auf dem Kabel aufliegt und wackelt.
Zudem muss der Ring für die Apple Watch immer senkrecht stehen, da sonst das Kabel geknickt wird. Ich persönlich fänd es schöner, wenn man den Ring samt Watch-Ladestation einfach komplett oder zumindest ein wenig umklappen könnte.
Ein weiteres Manko wenn das Gerät auf dem Nachttisch steht: die blinkenden LEDs.

Ansonsten lädt alles wie es soll, wirkt relativ hochwertig verarbeitet und erfüllt den Zweck.",3

The description does not convey this clearly at all. Luckily I was able to dig up an old charger that is able to supply 9v and a microUSB cable. With these charging pad does in fact work as expected. It needs to be made much much clearer in the description that it does not accept USC-C, and the photos need to reflect that.",2

B09123BHRG,R1D3I2Z5D8EUFP,Trash,I bought this thinking oh this will be wonderful and took 3 days before it broke. Not worth buying at all in my opinion.,1

B07R7K2QMW,R16OQX7D3DSCY2,So Far So Good,"This seemed like a no-brainer. Apple doesn’t provide the wall adapters anymore, and everything is going USB-C. Apple’s own version is too expensive, not surprisingly. I took a chance that a third-party brand I’ve never heard of would be ok. Given the number of positive reviews, it seemed like a safe bet. So far it’s worked out well. I bought two, and haven’t had any issues with either one. They charge fast at lower SOCs but it slows down noticeably once you get to 80%. But that’s a device safety thing, and has nothing to do with this unit. I can charge my iphone 13 from 20% to 100% in about an hour, and my Apple Watch from 30% to 100% in about 20 minutes. If you’re under 80% and just need a little pick-me-up for your device, a few minutes is all you need.",5

B08JY8BH95,R18OSS02U1QPAZ,So convenient,This is the most convenient product I have purchased. It is so much easier to lay my phone down and and receive a charge. I don’t have to worry about the cable on a regular charger to wear and have to replace from bending it.,5

B0746Y8C6H,R2L8XWNICPHY,Fast Charge!,"My husband uses this to charge his phone in his truck. He has a long drive and his phone is always dying.

He likes that there's a blue light that glows while plugged in, because it illuminates that area and he can see the console. Plus, I think he just likes the cool light.

This does charge fast. A big plus is that this has two jacks, so a passenger can also charge his/her phone at the same time.

The only drawback comes when using it in an outlet inside the house. The prongs are folded down. Trying to fish them out and lift them is difficult for a guy with bigger hands and short fingernails. I didn't have a problem with that part, but I have small fingers and enough fingernail to slide underneath and pull up.",5

B083DLKFRR,R3GK78XNFVFF1U,Works well with Samsung S7,We bought this to replace a lost OEM charger for a Samsung S&. We wanted one that would allow the same fast charge feature as the OEM.

And this was the only one I’ve found so far. The only reason it didn’t get five stars from me is the downsides, it shows it’s first gen. It charges very slowly even when plugged into a fast charger. And the magnets are strong , but a big bump will knock the phone off. It also needs a rubberized surface to reduce motion and vibrations from driving. After those changes it will be perfect.",4

 I really love this charging station. I work a desk job at home and this stand is perfect to charge my phone while allowing me to see the screen. Also charge my ear buds at the same time. (I actually have a second one at my bedside and love it there too!) The quality is great, has nice features like rubberized ledge for your phone to sit on, impressive charging power and so easy to throw in your laptop bag when you’re on the fly! Scan the QR code on the card and follow the simple steps to get your free travel bag for the charger. Customer service was fantastic. Will be ordering more for Christmas gifts- can’t go wrong with these, even for those “hard to buy for” person who has everything- you can never have too many chargers!!!",5

Charged both her phone and watch. Well it’s the 29’th and not working for the watch. My wife’s watch spent the night on charger and no charge last night. I came home from work and she told me her watch wouldn’t change. Well it does charger but the charger isn’t working. Her phone was fully changed but was wasn’t. I thought, well she must not have set it on right. It is magnetic but I figured she must not have set it right. I put it on and looked for the watch to show charging. Looked good until a heard the tone. Wasn’t sure what I was hearing but thought, that’s coming from the watch. I walked up to it and monitor. A min or 2 later I heard the tone again. I saw the watch flash and I was charging over again. This happened several more time. I ended pulling the plug and using the watch cable. Wasn’t an hour later the watch was charged. I thought I had read all the reviews and picked a good one. Well no. This didn’t last 5 days. Returning and looking for something else. Would have really liked this to work but it failed.",1

B08QHH25X3,R2CCON3J128SUP,Perfect!,Thin and compact. Exactly as described . Has great thin line of blue or green light to display device in dark without overwhelming glare.

I'd recommend choosing a different product.",1

Takes about 3 hours to fully charge my iPhone and 2 hours to fully charge apple watch, but I have not tried to charge all 3 devices at once. Only disappointment is needing to use your own watch charging cord, but I spent $12 for an additional one. Definitely recommend for those who want the convenience of having one charger and plug for everything.

The spring behind the contact at the end has too much tension; which consistently causes the charging port to push away from the bottom of the 12-volt outlet, remain unseated and lack power.

I find their designs well thought out, aesthetically pleasing, and made well with high quality materials. This is no exception. They even thought to turn the prongs so that the plug doesn't have to be overly big, and isn't a socket stealer (one of those plugs which drive you crazy by covering the other socket too). With power IQ, it sends the appropriate amount of power to my Qi charger, and another USB powered object (like my Air Pods on another Qi charger), cutting down on some of the plug clutter. Like every other Anker product I've had, I love it!

B08NR6FCVL,RFJZFPH3R1QK4,Samsung Quality and Performance!,This Samsung charger works exceptionally well. Fast charging. The thick cord and heavy charger let you know this was money well spent. This will provide years of reliable service. Don't waste your money on knockoffs.,5
B09LYD2KTM,R18ECL5NYMLRJR,WORKS PERFECT!,The price was great! The charger works very well and charges very quick. The Magnet is strong and hold the phone with no issues.

B08L5NP6NG,R2BMRFX3NP4TTW,Be prepared to spend more,Doesn’t include the wall component. Given the very recent change to usb-c this almost necessitates paying an additional $15 to actually be able to charge your phone. Hard to defend that sort of money grab.,1

B09NZQFY22,R1RTUMCH7YNI07,Works exactly as I expected,Love it. Charges the three devices perfectly. I do wish that there was a nighttime setting for the charger base — it can be a little bright to sleep in the same room. But it works perfectly.,5
B09B1T7685,R8HSDAIOH8O1V,Great charger,Convenient to have all 3 in one charger. Good space saving design. I wish I didn’t have to take the otter box off my phone to charge it but no other complaints.,4

B09KH3Z9MF,R2II2IHCQIMMFF,"Good, but make sure it’s charging before walking away","This charger works well but I recommend making sure it has started charging before you leave the room and automatically assume it has connected. Takes a couple times every once in a while (maybe it’s just the one I received). Specifically bought it for the fact that you can turn the light off while it charges. No bright or blinking lights in a dark room is a plus, for sure.",4

I love the Anker brand and the charging speed of this charger is amazing, but the light from the charger lights up my whole room. I wish there were a way to turn the light off or dim it. I am forced to put a piece of electrical tape over the light. Again, great product, but the engineers obviously didn't have to sleep in the same room as their charger.",3
B09LT9164F,RK37S752WRL42,Charges iPhone vertically and horizontally,I bought this particular charging station because I wanted to get rid of the alarm clock on my nightstand by utilizing a clock app on my phone. I wanted something that allowed my phone to be charged horizontally in addition to the vertical. This station also charges my iPhone and AirPods. I believe it also charges the pen but I don't have one of those. There does appear to be a space for it. I have been using this product for over a month now and find it to be quite satisfactory for what I wanted it to do. Very easy to use.,5

B07TTJ6KSH,R2K8XVE5CXT9I7,Nur bedingt zu empfehlen,"Unter „Schnellladen“ verstehe ich etwas anderes. Warum soll ich soviel Geld ausgeben und habe nur Nachteile? Trotz kauf des dazugehörigen Ladegerätes ist die Ladezeit grottenschlecht.

Vergleich mit einem S10 und S10+ 30% Rest Akku
- mit PowerWave 2:25Std.
- mit USB Ladekabel 1:15Std.

Wenn man schnell ein aufgeladenes Handy benötigt ist dies die letzte Wahl.

Es gibt aber auch Vorteile:
- kein Kabel am Handy
- Verarbeitung Top
- sieht klasse aus

Schade, war ein Geschenk was im Nachhinein nichts nützt.",2

the light changes to show that the pad senses a phone, but charging does not take place..

as far as when it did work, phone needed to be placed very carefully for charging to begin, and would sometimes stop mid charge... very disappointing.

Wwould not reccomend!",1
B082SV1NF1,R3DAEB0ZUWJPS0,Is working well for me,"A few things to know, wireless charging for iPhone is pretty slow any time, overnight my iPhone 12 gets a 100% charge. The watch charger is a little sketchy but it does work as long as I make sure the band is not preventing it from getting a good connection to the charger. So far every morning I find both my devices fully charged and ready for the day. Durability might be an issue with the ring that holds the watch charger, time will tell.

You get used to it so you will notice it. But at first you may not so your charge can be in and out. Not sure why they didn't make this product just a little better. Ive owned other Car chargers and they stay stuck in the port, like you literally have to try to pry it out to remove it. This is not the case with this charger and I would not buy again. I will keep it only because I am someone who tosses the packing as soon as I open an item so I could not return it. I would not recommend.",3
B07GTZ89NH,RPIO9WLM72B3S,Just make sure to check for movement in positive wire at fuse,"Works great, charged my phone to 80% in a 20 minute drive from 20%. Only issue I ran into was an easy fix, the wire going to the fuse didn't seat nicely, but easy enough fix!",5

When the item arrived it worked, although the phone pad half made a bit of a whirring noise when it was charging. After about 45 days the phone pad half has stopped working completely. The watch half still works, but now it's not serving the purpose I had hoped for. Working with Samsung support to see if they can fix or replace as it's outside of the return window of 30 days.",2

Dislikes (and this may just be my devices? Idk): Both of my devices, the smart watch, a Galaxy 4 Classic & my phone, the Z Fold 3, have a hard time finding ""the hot spot"" to start charging. Maybe if it integrated a magnet for the smart watch in the future? Like the one that comes standard with the watch. That would help. And a larger surface area for the phone.

And yeah the cord is short but in the car you don't really want a long cable. But if you do want one, buy one. Cable is just thrown in with the charger. Most new phones don't even come with chargers.

B094FQSGMM,R2NTO8YHIZJQI1,Inexpensive and perfect for what I was looking for.,I've had a couple of mornings where I discovered my phone had not charged because it was note placed perfectly on my old wireless charger.

So I bought this one, and it's better in every way. My phone would slip and slide off the other other and this one is sturdy and holds it up so the charge is steady and my phone can be charged so much more quickly. I kinda wish I'd have gotten this earlier so maybe my USB port wouldn't have broken. Sooo happy with this charger though!",5

B07F6RTHV7,RV354IBQW53B2,If you have a large family get this 5 pack!,"I have two problems in my house. One is we're half iPhone Users and half android users, and everyone always needs to plug in at the same time. The other is my family isn't courteous enough to leave a wall charger for anyone else to use. Oh, another thing is there's always a minimum of 2 or 3 devices that need to be plugged in...ok, one more, and most plugs aren't rated for iOS devices.

These chargers solved all of that. First, FIVE came in a pack. One for each member of the family (Two for me. I bought then for goodness sakes). Second, they are color coded so everyone got their favorite color, so NO ONE should be confused as to which wall charger is who's anymore. Third, they work perfectly with iOS devices. And finally, there are TWO ports on the block.

I don't remember how much I paid for them, but I know it was cheaper than buying ONE iOS(Apple) charging device. I got FIVE....technically TEN because of the dual port. It was a no brainer.",5

Some of them are old and you never know if the 12V plug works or not. On long days, my phone and Ipad do not have enough battery, so charging in the air is important. The display lets me quickly check there is power at the outlet and the USB-C and USB-A ports make it easy to connect any cord I have. The first adapter I received work great, except I could not charge any devices, despite which cable I used. The display indicated the voltage, but no charge. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement and so far so good.",5

The front charging stand is at a good angle to charge and look at your phone at the same time and it does charge on landscape mode which is great if you want to watch movies.

B00YRYS4T4,R256CPMND3XLJU,"like me, want to be sure that your devices ...","The description says ""60W"" of output, but what does that mean?

The unit is designed for devices requiring 5V, so what that 60W means is that it is capable of a total output of 12A (60W/5V=12A).

12A/10 USB ports = 1.2A per port. What this means is that the unit is capable of simultaneously charging 10 cellular phones requiring 1A or more of power at once -- or 5 tablets that require up to 2.4A of input for proper charging.

Apart from this unit, Anker also makes a set of nifty 1-ft. cords for charging (see first photo).

If you, like me, want to be sure that your devices are actually charging -- but not overcharging -- then AboutTEK can help you know that for only $6.99 per unit. The units automatically show, alternately, in bright orange that can be read from a distance both the voltage and the amperage that the charger is putting into each device (see second and third photos).

You say you want to know more than just the voltage and the amperage, and you don't need to see the monitoring device from a distance? The item in the fourth photo will also tell you how many coulombs and mW have been loaded into the batteries of your devices.

Want to know that your device is truly fully charged?

These devices will tell you when the charger is putting 0.0A into each of your devices.",5

B093FDLLKW,RTICLJ0G70BRM,You don’t have to mount it on the dash,"The suction could be a little stronger but if you use the included clamp close enough to the suction cup, then it seems to keep a strong hold. The adhesive with the provided clamp was not strong enough. I had to use some double sided 30lb Gorilla Tape to hold the clamp in place. I also added some Gorilla Tape behind the mounting plate to keep it from bouncing around which can be seen in the photos. I don’t like the look of large mounting contraptions stuck to my windshield or my dash. I mounted the suction under my steering wheel which makes it look much cleaner and it is very sturdy (with the added Gorilla Tape).

The magnetic mount works great and charging works perfect.",4

Unfortunately this product did not work, and I bought 2; one for me and one for my sweetie. First night we charged our iPhone 12s, Apple Watch series 6s and gen 2 AirPod Pros. After 8 hours of charge the first night the best the watches charged to was 84 and 83%. Next night we tried different combinations of power units, power cords and finally the old chargers in the combination. The watchers constantly lost charge and the phones slowly gained. Finally after about 60 minutes saw the first positive charge on either watch. Switched to our old chargers using the same power units and cord combinations and within one hour the charge on the phones and watches were close to full. Returning both. The search continues.",1

B08J49THFB,R2RI01CPKA83E1,Good - but not Samsung compatible,"Nicely made, and the LED indicators are an attractive and functional touch. However, these units are NOT compatible with Samsung for fast wireless charging. Samsung has recently started restricting fast wireless charging to units that have been certified by Samsung. This is enforced in their software, which turns off fast wireless charging mode when it senses a charging plate that doesn't meet their standard. This affects almost all Samsung phones and tablets, and leads to charging times dramatically longer than you'd hope.",3
B08T5QVTKW,R3FU1RQYO1M50E,Compact and fast charging,Purchased the Anker charger due to the fact that the Samsung fast charger for the Galaxy S22 Ultra was sold out.

That charger had a short cord that needed a usb extension to reach my usb jack on the floor. This unit has a three foot cord so it reaches from my night stand to the floor.

I am happy with this purchase.",5
B072NDT8HJ,R1YK4N7YI2X0OS,Beeps.,"After using for several months, the charger started a high pitched beeping, though subtle, that severely disturbed our sleep.

We almost replaced a ceiling fan because of it. I would t recommend this product.",3
B083B9HB6Q,R23SKLB6YOF7S7,STAY AWAY,Bought this with the intention of having an easier time of not always looking for the traditional charger. Used this one time (ONE TIME) on my iPhone 8 plus as soon as it arrived. it worked perfectly. The very next day I plugged it in and there's no blue light indicating its on. I continuously placed my iPhone on to charge and there was nothing going on. Less than 12 hours from out of the box and it broke.

However, after only a couple months, it just stopped working. I contacted the seller and they were great. They shipped a replacement to me right away and things were great again. I’m not entirely sure what the lifespan is on these wireless chargers being that they aren’t very expensive, but the replacement that they provided just stopped working again. It has been about 10 months so this one definitely lasted longer than the first one. But I guess I was hoping to get a year + out of a charger that literally just sits on the counter and charges my device each night. I don’t take it anywhere, move it or anything. I could try contacting the seller again but instead, I just ordered a different brand. Will see if that one is any better. The new one came with notice of an 18 month warranty so it’s already looking better than the Yootech model!",3

The issue I had was that due to the length of the unit it tends to fall out of an outlet too easily, specifically at hotels which often have ""well worn"" (read worn-out) outlets. I decided to use it in a power strip where it stands upright. As a charger it works just fine, handling my IPad, Note 20 Ultra, and Galaxy Watch without issue. The Note 20 charges at the Super Fast rate. It is worth mentioning that the middle USB port does not charge at that rate. It is suitable for my Galaxy Buds and watch.

B08KSKNGRZ,R322WJ1KN93YJL,Highly Disappointed,"This product charges very slowly. When charging anywhere from 5-15% to fully charged with the cord usually takes approximately 1 hr 5-10 minutes. With this wireless charger, it takes approximately 2 hrs 15 mins and that's without the cover protector on my cellphone. I didn't use it right away and now I'm sorry I didn't. I would have returned it for my money back. It's worthless to me.",2

B09CDL7KQY,R14AOCJDBNYM9H,Both are really fast chargers,"The new Samsung 22S Ultra has an extra large 5,000mAH battery, but does not come with cables or chargers. My old chargers were too slow. This charger will charge my 22S Ultra from 15 to 100% in 1 hour and 5 minutes. It is a bit faster if the phone is face down on a metal surface to absorb heat from the phone. The car charger works equally well in the super fast PD charger mode. Some of my old cables don't support the fast charge, so it was nice that two new cables came with the chargers. The price was right and the charging times were great!",5

B01CH9NEM2,R1WR9GFLG824AW,This product works fine and does the rapid-charge on my Nexus 5x,"This product works fine and does the rapid-charge on my Nexus 5x, so that's good.

I have two issues, which are pretty YMMV as far as ""issues"" go:
1. The coiled cable is really, really short. Like, even when I stretch it with my hands, its maximum stretch is like, 2 feet at most. When coiled, it's less than a foot. Which might be fine if that works for your car, but it makes it basically impossible for me to actually do anything, even pick up and check the screen, of my phone when it's plugged in. (My previous car charger was more like 2 feet coiled and 3-4 feet stretched, so it was much more manageable.)
2. The blue LED. WHY does there need to be a BRIGHT BLUE LED on this? It's blinding when driving at night - depending on the angle relative to your eyes, probably, but that's just the way my car slot is set up - and blue KILLS night vision. (Couldn't it be red, if you really need to have a charging indicator at all beyond your device actually charging?) It literally casts a blue glow on my car ceiling, which I always mistake for cop car lights, and I could probably cast shadow puppets in the light on my ceiling if I wanted to. I don't understand at all why every single techy thing these days *has* to have blue LEDs - at least don't put it on things meant for use in the car!",3
B07KVQXJSY,R3AVT05BFOLQYN,Better than most,I have purchased multiple chargers and so far this one has held up better than any other. Months later it is still fast charging and has not died like most others.,5

It flashes green/blue when it's being ""charged"" and ends up draining my battery. It does better when the phone I placed on there horizontally, but then my AirPods aren't being charged as it pushes then back just far enough that they aren't on the charger. I like the design otherwise and love that I can get my watch, AirPods charging as well.",3

B092T642MR,R2OAU9ZY7MPCB,Fast Charging - Perfect,"I acquired these chargers for my phone but they work on all kinds of devices, including Switch. The cord is plenty long and the connections when plugged in are solid. They do, indeed, charge fast, just as advertised. Best of all, two pair of chargers are included. That makes it easy to have one at home and one at work.",5
B07V6JRRQ6,R25W3BHAJO5IEI,Slim and SO EASY,"Just plug it in, place your device on it and watch the rings go from green to blue! Charged my husband's months-dead Samsung in a surprising amount of time.
And my son left his substantial phone case on his iPhone and it charged it as well. That was really nice! Taking your case off and on is such a pain in the behind.
The slim disc design is pretty spiffy as well. I hate cords and chargers everywhere. This is just perfect to get rid of all that!",5

And choosing this product will leave you with no regret.,"Even when not on sale, this is just a standard and essential accessory to have laying around. The quality of this charger's top-notch and has a good quality build. I use mine daily and carry around a second one in my traveling pouch and day pack when traveling. I've also had mine utilize all 4 ports charging multiple phones. Despite having multiple devices charging on it, I did not experience any heating or charging issues.",5

B087T2B7DY,R396YAU867GKD2,Highly recommend this charger,This charger is great for my bedside cabinet. The fact the apple watch sits upright to show the time and that you can turn your phone horizontal to watch videos makes this perfect.,5
B08FJD9CB7,R3CH12U2OD8SSH,"Have to remove case, otherwise great.",Decent but I had to remove my phone from the case to use as I have a metal disc for car mount. Kind of defeats the purpose of wireless charging for me.,4

B09F2VSY1R,R2A9D5RJ4KANUI,Good charger.,"Bought one about a month ago for charging at night. Liked it enough to buy a second charger for our desk. Works great on new iPhone 12 and will charge the older iPhone XR. The XR doesn’t have the magnet attachment, charges by setting on the charger.",5
B0734SN6VR,R3QFS1YWDRCIOZ,Acceptable charger,"These chargers work, and can charge two devices simultaneously, apparently at quick charge power.

B07D9WK6VT,RKS4IODLZ1O59,I’ve Had Better...,Only used this a couple times and it seems like it’s coming apart from the seems of it - also don’t like the way it charges - it has 4 ports but the minute you plug more than one it takes a really really long time to charge...I’ve had better,2

B07D11946L,RQALO46JMP0WF,Barely functional charger with lots of issues,Seemed nice at first until it became apparent how many issues there are.

One of the chargers charged my phone but not my Bluetooth headphones, the other would charge my headphones but not my phone, and both of them would turn off at random and stop charging completely, and of course I kept my phone case off for these tests.

B08RHW8V6X,R3VUBPMMFDCZE6,ottimo prodotto ESR,"Ho altri prodotti ESR, in particolare un caricatore USBC veramente ben fatto e leggero. Anche questo prodotto non delude: compatibile con i prodotti apple di ultima generazione, sia lato smartwatch che lato smartphone. Per quest'ultimo integrato un elemento magnetico compatibile con gli iphone serie 12, mentre lato watch serve il connettore originale (che comunque evidentemente chi possiede l'orologio della mela deve per forza già avere). Attenzione che per i 30 euro richiesti, non è compreso l'alimentatore; io ho utilizzato il suddetto usbc da 20w della stessa ESR, e il tutto funziona perfettamente.
Importantissimo, cosa scritta nel manuale, è il fatto che vada in standby quando non è collegato in carica con nessun device, cosa che non è così scontata negli apparecchi della concorrenza. Le 4 stelle sono legate ad un prezzo non proprio entusiasmante (soprattutto vista la mancanza dell'alimentatore), ma la qualità si paga",4

B07MH24J43,R3FVDJ7BGY0X8I,Works / nice looking,"I prefer chargers in something other than black or white, to distinguish mine from others, and this one does the job. The only issue is if you have a mini Apple watch charger: the direction of the plug does not allow it if you use it in a wall socket.",5
B07PRQ1BX7,R15TOPP7EI5G0S,Works great!,Very happy with my purchase. It’s very convenient to charge three of my devices at once without having to look for different wall adapters. I bought this for travel but use it at home all the time now too since it’s easier. It seems to charge my devices quickly as well. I’ve seen similar ones in stores with only two USB ports that cost more.,5

Easily the fastest charger in its price range. My first thoughts when taking it out of the box: It felt well made and expertly designed. HOWEVER, in the first few hours of use, one of the ports no longer works. As soon as I plugged in another device, the port already in use died...

I am contacting customer support and will update my review after my experience.",2

B09B3MTXFL,R3B2YNLBNIC8UU,Great Charging Block for iPhone 13 Pro Max,"Bought for iPhone 13 Pro Max and has worked quite well. Fast Charging is noticeable with a 50% charging taking approximately 45 minutes (taking into account the 13 Pro Max larger battery capacity). Overall, a valuable bundle for a great price.

B016ZNTUQA,R1GB8U28RWB6S7,Great charger and 1/2 the price of other big brands,Love it. bought it for me then my wife stole it for her home office. so I bought another one. It does deliver more than enough power to do a quick charge on newer devices,5

B09M8FGSJ6,R3RSAW3KXBCV4J,Smaller isn't always better,"Product can NOT be used with a case on. Have tried 3 different phones with different cases, and the charger started flashing red within 10 minutes on all 3 phones. Switched to a different charger that I had purchased for my son (doesn't do wireless charging for Air Pods) and all the phones charged fine with each of their cases on and quicker.

B0734RKVLT,R3K9AYFK2E3E26,Caution: Hot Item (literally),"I bought these a year or two ago, and while they initially worked, within a few months of each other they started overheating. The first one that died was on a vacation, ad was so hot I could barely touch it long enough to unplug it. The second one lasted a few months longer, but I went to go plug my phone in tonight and realized it was super hot too. So while they’re cheap, they’re not trustworthy. I’m just glad they didn’t catch fire or fry an electronic before they decided they were done.",2

That’s not to say that I still believe Apple could have afforded to include this with the phone. Their “going green” excuse is ridiculously hypocritical as Apple planned from the very beginning to produce these charging blocks, but only as a part to be sold separately. It’s all about the profit with this company.",5

Purchased this to charge my iPhone 8, both at my office and at home. It’s small and convenient and easy to pack for travel.

I absolutely love the fact that I’m not attached to a charging cable when I take a phone call or reply to a text. I just pick it up off the charger take the call or reply to the text and lay it back down.

We have recently eliminated all of our office phones and gone 100% cellular. This charger makes it easy to use the speaker phone while charging as well.

I’m trying to figure out how long it takes to completely charge my device. This isn’t a changer issue, I just pick it up and set it down ALOT! But hey...No charging cords to get tangled in, just a charged phone.

Next step, I think I’ll need one for the car...🤔",5

B01JLXTQ1U,R39R3BSPSL38R8,Straight out of my imagination,I've been waiting for a flat outlet like this for ages! The box itself fits the palm of my (small) hand so it would be perfect for domestic trips since you can just toss it in your bag.

Update: These were always loose at the phone connection (I was assured it fit an LG Stylo 2), and after one year exactly, both chargers quit working. I tried the USB cord from my old fast charger (5 years old and still working), but they still didn't work. I ordered two new chargers (same model number as my old fast charger) from a different vendor and I'll throw these away.",1

Installed it in the tv stand today and spent the rest of the day chasing this barely audible but absolutely infuriating whining sound.... like the kind of sound they use in movies to drive the characters to insanity.

Finally remembered that I never heard the sound until I installed the charger.... don't know if its a fan or something else but when I put my ear to it, yep, coming from this.",2

All the others required the phone (with case) be just right or either the phone would not start charging or, it would stop charging soon after it began. Not with this one. I don't know how they did it but, I can just plop it down kinda sorta in the middle and I hear the charging chime. It amazes me. credit cards preventing it from working. I have my license and 2 cards in a smartish case and no problem. Once you discover wireless charging it's a huge game changer.
While in the dark bedroom you grab the phone to check on this or that, it's dark but there are some very cool lights that let you know where to lay it back down. They don't interfere with sleep and go out a few seconds after connected to the iPhone. Not sure why Apple hasn't promoted this feature more than they have. It seems charging is a never ending battle with smart phones. No longer. If you're in need of one buy this one!",5

It has the charging ling on it and does not look bad, I chose this option for her rather than the tinny ones because I felt it would not be such high quality, no complains about this one so far.

I think the packaging was really good for what we paid for, is well hold and with some wrapping paper to avoid any scratches, after removing the paperwork for the warranty and that it shows logos for the packaging bein Eco Friendly and Frustartion free, totally is!

I bought multiple wall chargers, was about to purchase Anker Dual Usb, finally decided for an iClever, but Anker has really good reviews in all their products and you can't go wrong with them or beat their prices. I am considering to purchase portable bluetooth speakers and Anker seems to be my best option in multiple price range.

If you go with name brands you will pay more, keep in mind we are testing non recognized brands trusting them, hoever you get what you are paying for.

This was bought with my own money, this is my personal opinion and experience.
Would love to test new Anker product.

If you forget your phone on the charger it simply stops charging once it is charged and truly does float charge, at least on my Samsung. You won't bake your battery to death.

I even used this at times for my phone. Suddenly noticed that it was not charging as fast and then immediately noticed the charger would charge for a second and then stop. Then charge, stop, charge, stop and so on.

This will not hold a steady charge and is annoying.

I went on their website and there is no one to talk to. I am in the chat now and the auto reply has stopped.

B08HNBHSQV,R3QFTVPQ7QNKKE,Charger works good but the vent holder didn't work for me,The charger part works well but the piece that connects to the vent didn't work well with my 2018 Ford edge. However I had another magnetic holder that did connect well to my vent and I swapped it and it is now useable. I believe the piece that connects to the vent needs work.,4

B07MP2R6CS,RKZIHVVXCXI1P,Super handy,"(Almost) nothing is more annoying than being in a hotel room and having too few outlets. Let's be honest, we all have too many ""toys"" these days--laptop, a couple cell phones, perhaps a WiFi hotspot and/or shaver, etc. Most are USB powered, and we all gotta feed em! But the engineers that design the electrical setup in hotel rooms apparently don't understand this. Thankfully there are products such as these where you can get 3-for-one.",5
B08K8DNVB4,R35XVOIWQ3ZJHG,Multi-Fuctions!,I used the similar one before but that one is hard to use and annoying. But This one is really useful I use this one for my iphone and iwatch and airpod and very easy to use and sturdy,5

B09CDL7KQY,RP71PE4D2DDXU,Super Speedy Charging and Stylish too!,"Like most people I usually want, or need, to charge one of my devices but my charger is in another room; in my case, I'm to Lazy and Impatient to go get it. Hence, the reason why I got this charging set. The cables are covered with a nice sturdy cloth that won't get dirty too soon. Also not only does it come with a plug but a car charger as well. I needed to replace a cheap one that I mistakenly bought before, which didn't last. Everything feels like it's a hefty weight which makes me believe that it's going to last. The charger lives up to its promise...super fast charging! I definitely recommend this set to anyone who's shopping around.",5
B00WIW42BQ,R3TQ5QM3VGW7I2,Can't charge more than one device and it hisses,"I just recevied this charger and I am trying to charge just two devices at the same time and I can't, which completely defeats the purpose.

B07X3G6WBH,R19I7BSUW9AXN5,Very nice charging station.,"I like how strong the magnet is for the watch. My watch was constantly falling off the standard charger, with the slightest bump to my nightstand. With this charger, I no longer have that problem. I also like the light at its base. It makes it so easy to see if the phone is situated correctly, and it helps with locating the phone in the dark.",5
B07MSFFDNP,R19118TB36GPV0,Love not having to plug it in.,I love these chargers have one on each bed side table for me and the hubby. We also have my son one and have a couple around the house for a quick easy charge. So nice not to have to plug it in.,5

B0712252ZQ,R13HTX57XEWG5T,More than I had hoped for,"Purchased this for an international trip as my only charger. It worked beyond my hopes in that it charged everything I brought. I had an iPad mini, USB-C android, 2 Samsung phones, battery banks and a HP Envy x360 15.6"". If I had all the USB-a ports charging it would still charge the laptop, slower but charged. Since it's universal voltage I purchased a couple power cords for it with the international plugs so I didn't have to use adapters and they worked perfectly. I could not be more happy with this product.",5

B07THTZY9S,R2ICVFJESOPY95,Gets hot and shuts on and off!,"We tried to use these with our Samsung phones, a Galaxy S20 FE and a Galaxy Z, and both would cause the charger to get very hot to touch while charging and then shut off and restart (causing the reconnect sound like happens when you first plug it in). I returned these and bought Samsung brand ones for only a few dollars more. I do not recommend this product.",1
B07QVL8ZXW,R2ATSKSA7C2Z0Z,Less than 3months,Looks pretty good and good quality but the charger gets real hot if you plug iPad and iPhone at the same time. And less than 3 months and one cable is not working anymore. No worth it.,1
B07M6PKB9W,RN9MMSEWXV0U3,Wire reducer,"We needed a solution for our 3 iPads, 1 iPhone, 1 watch in the upstairs game room. All the outlets were taken up with chargers. I bought this in hopes of getting all my kids stuff in one location and get rid of all the wires. This unit accomplished what I wanted. The unit arrived with a broken Apple Watch mount and the company is sending a replacement. The card that came in the package has all the relevant information you need for help. The device does hold all the newer iPads and iPad Pro 12"" gen2. We have serious cases on them as well. It is a little tight, but it does fit.

The power switch button not in a very ergonomic location, but I am not turning this unit on and off all the time, so it is not a big deal. The cords are long enough to plug in and we now don't have the question ""where is my iPad?!"".

We are pretty happy with the product. If you have a lot of devices you will need to add this to your book shelf.",4

B07R7K2QMW,R2QX1NYZCA0XXI,Great for Apple Watch,"I read several review for similar products that said not to use with apple watches. Well, that is the sole purpose of my purchase.

B07Q6WM3FF,RYQE5H4MWPING,Power cord for Samsung Galaxy Tab A,The only problem is that the part that I plug into my Samsung Galaxy Tab A was the wrong size. I had another accessory that I used in place of the wire. Otherwise the plug unit is fine.,3

B083S8418Z,R1BI11E1GEHG8S,Like the product,I do love this charger. I bought it for both me and my husband. It’s awesome to only have to plug kn thing into the wall. I would give it 5 stars all the way but the part to charge your AirPods doesn’t work on mine or my husband’s. When I first bought them neither of us had AirPods. I since have bought AirPods and that’s when I realized that neither of them work.,4
B089G6RM6Z,R4FI6QE2VCM3O,First day is great than a week later nothing,"Bought two of these chargers to minimize cords. However when first opened it worked like a charm, now a week later and one charger is draining the phone and the other charger won’t even charge my watch or phone after 2 hours. Will be returning as these are very misleading. Almost positive half the reviews are from the initial unboxing.",1
B086SM2KWH,R12131C2AY1OKF,Stopped working,I was initially happy with this charger but after only a few months it has stopped working. It seems to connect (the battery on the phone shows charging) but then it doesn’t actually charge. The phone charges fine with other chargers so it’s not the phone itself.,1
B0995QL2LJ,R31TWB5LKYQEQV,Love this product,"I bought this when I had my iPhone 11. I loved it then, I just had to take off my phone case. Yeah it’s kind of a pain to take it off and on, but then I got my iPhone 13 mini, and I don’t have to take the case off. It connects and starts charging immediately. I love having my watch and phone in the same place charging. I don’t have a lot of cords and everything is right there. It’s kind of bulky so I wouldn’t be taking it traveling, I will take my wall chargers.",5

B0797F2V5C,R3D93QGE0B7UV6,works with otterbox defender case,I took a chance on buying this for ease of charging my phone with no cords. I have a LG G6 that does not support fast wireless charging but will charge with this pad with my otterbox defender case on it at a pretty decent rate. I just set my phone on it and it just starts charging with no fumbling. I bought this one for more money than the others simply because of the fan. I believe that heat from the charger pad and phone greatly affects how fast and how well these chargers work. The fan seems to work because my phone and the pad do not heat up while charging. It is smaller than I thought it looked in the pictures which I am glad. I am happy with this purchase because of the fan and the fact it works with my case on. All of that said I really like it. It works as it is supposed to. It also comes with it's own power supply and cord. No need to guess at which voltage or amps needed to power this. Comes complete with everything needed out of box to use.,5
B07FM8R7J1,RDBWCNGHAVWVG,Technology our ancestors never dreamed of for the price of a funnel cake,"Silly cheap, does what it says, wireless inductive charging. Also does what it doesn’t say, emits barely audible high pitched noises. Would love the first without the second. Maybe they all do that, I’m just a random dude on Amazon, not an expert.",4
B077XS5LSD,R17668MEYNWFG9,Great product!,I love these. They work great and I love that you can charge 2 devices at a time. Colors are great to prevent md from forgetting them when traveling.,5
B08FBFJDQ1,R5DHJ54RWDWS0,Samsung Duo Wireless,Samsung 20FE charges on pad no problem.,5
B081Z8413L,R3LG7WGDVYJGMW,This Charging Pad is HOT,"It definitely works to charge my Pixel 4 and my Gear Sè Frontier wirelessly, but there are 2 problems:

1) This is definitely NOT a fast charger. So, ideally it'll be great for charging your stuff on a nightstand as you sleep. But....

2) It made my watch get very hot. My watch got so hot after sitting on the charger overnight that it entered a low-power mode to protect itself after giving a ""Very hot"" warning message.

My phone will also get hot as well, sometimes. I don't use cases on ant of my devices so I'm returning this item. It's a shame because the convenience of wireless charging is awesome but I don't like my devices constantly getting so hot.",2

B07VP3HLGW,R1JVM4K73XYW63,"Not compatible with 25W Galaxy Note 10+ , but still fast charge it with 15W","This charger performs well on USB-A port, all ok there, but USB-C port is not compatible with Note 10+ 25W fast charging. I measured only 15W for NOTE 10+, which is still fine, it says fast charging and only reduces overall time with 25 min from 1h and 10 min with wall original 25W charger to 1h and 35 min charging from 0-100% with this car charger and original note 10+ cable.
Of course charging at slower speeds might increase the battery life, but PD3.0 doesn't necessarely means is compatible with PD3.0 from Samsung.
Overall the product is perfect for powerbanks and small laptops at slow speed, but not for NOTE 10+ , unless you are happy with only 15W.",4
B08SLRM618,R32308Z01FI9Q0,Almost perfect,"I wish I could give this 5 stars, however I can’t. I gave 4, because no matter what I did, how I turn the case etc this just will NOT charge my AirPods at all! Which is totally, totally frustrating! Everything else is as described and works beautifully. I would still recommend, being that I don’t see this issue on other reviews (so maybe I got a defective model). I would say try it out and hope for a good one! I still couldn’t beat the price and I love it for my phone & watch.",4
B088LXDH2M,ROMWJ6QZV3DW1,Don’t waste your money!,"The air pods part of the charger does not work at all. My phone was on the charger for about 5 minutes and when I picked it up the phone was extremely hot. Also, the light around the bottom kept randomly turning back on no matter what we did.",1

There is a download link available to download the software needed in order to program each button for your mouse, however upon trying to open said program after installing, it won't recognize your mouse even exists.

I have opened the program WITH the mouse, and it still provides me an error that I need to have the mouse plugged in. How in the world am I opening the program with the mouse that needs to be plugged in, if it's not plugged in?? I'm not aware of any troubleshooting possible for this mouse, and I've swapped between multiple USB ports. They all act the same.

The mouse itself works fine, but I was really hoping to reprogram some of the keys to make them more versatile.",3
B09C5QWM71,R3W50BU8MZL3D2,Not super secure clamp hold,"Good value. Magnetic hold a little better than the previous one I bought. Vent clamp is a pinch clamp only and does not screw down tight.

The process of charging couldn't be more simple; plug the charger in, place your phone on top and that's it. A small LED light will alert you when your phone is charged and a full charge is quick. I haven't had a problem and I don't need to remove my phone case before charging. No problem in having to move the phone around to find the correct charging position which I've found a problem with different chargers in the past. Useful product.",5

B07DFWKBF7,R10AB1Y86JJ3FO,Compact design with double charging ports,"The """"charger for travel"""" has greatly advanced to the Anker model. TWO ports for charging with a neat design that folds smaller and reduces any chance for broken plugs or for snagging. The charger it replaced was the size of a deck of cards and had one port and the power prongs were just asking to snag or break. The anker with two ports puts that old charge out to pasture and is the size of two cubes of sugar.
Sweet!! (Pun intended)",5

When I got it, it worked great, but within a couple of days, I was finding that I had to unplug and plug back in to reset the charger, as it wouldn’t charge at least one of my devices. I would wake up and also find that it stopped charging my phone and/or watch as well.

I don’t mind an occasional inconvenience of unplugging/plugging back in, but when I have to do it everyday, the product has to go.

I went with the Belkin version similar to this look offered through Apple, and it’s made all the difference. Haven’t had any issues with that one.",2

Head ups: if you have the iPhone 12 mag safe case it will not charge with the metal inside of it you have to remove the phone from the case every time you charge it which is a pain. And even with the case off half the time the iPhone doesn’t charge it just flashes a blue light but charges the watch fine. I just received this and so far it feels kind of cheap the overall material isn’t bad but I plug it in and when I come back to it when there’s nothing connected to it at all and the blue light on the left is just flashing I haven’t had the green lights turn on at all during charge or when finished. I’m using the iPhone 12 Pro and the Apple Watch five and neither would show a green light when they were charged just blue light always on and then half the time it’s flashing whenever there’s nothing on it and for instance right now I cannot charge my iPhone because every time I put it on it starts flashing blue and doesn’t charge and if I take it off and put it back on it’ll say charging and then immediately start flashing blue again so I can’t charge my phone on it at all tonight. And I’ve tried unplugging it and replug it back in waiting a minute and then plugging it back in to no avail. So I’m definitely going to be returning this item. I’m dictating on returning this and maybe trying another.,4

I couldn’t afford a new phone, so I found and bought the Yootech charger. I have to admit, I really do like this charger a lot! It works great! I wish I had bought it a long time ago. I ended up buying more (of the stand up type), and used AGT tape on it, to secure it in my vehicle to charge phone while using GPS. Granted, the stereo usb doesn’t provide “Fast Charge” on my Samsung, but does charge fairly good. With the proper (I think) 7.5 watt usb wall plug, it does fast charge!

All we need to do is come up with a way to cover the light and then she'd rate it 5 stars!",4

B0769JN5MG,R1YUZYTJVYY27B,Worst fast charger in the world!,"Doesn't charge so well while you're using your phone. Just stays at the same percentage. So it doesn't fast charge worth AF.

This stand might charge it 10-15% in the 40 minutes or so it takes me to get ready in the morning, as compared to the Apple charger that came with the watch, which gets it back to a full charge in the same time.

If you don't sleep with your watch on, this will probably do the trick.",2
B00P933OJC,R25CSSIA9RFCSE,"Good product with a couple of ""gotchas""","[Edited — see end of review.]

The PowerPort was immediately useful and seems well made. Four stars rather than five for these reasons:

When I looked for a multi-port charger on Amazon, the PowerPort's description noted that tablets could be charged with it. This turns out to be _in_correct for either the two Samsung Galaxy Tabs I have (these are the original Galaxy Tab designs -- ancient by today's standards). I had several email exchanges about this with Anker. I passed along to them a couple of articles showing that the charging issue has been known about for a while -- there's something about older Galaxy Tab models that makes them impossible to charge using non-Samsung charging devices. I had already known about the problem. But I assumed from the product description that Anker had solved it. Anker apparently hadn't been aware of the issue at all, which surprised me a bit. They are now.

So I wouldn't call it a defect in the PowerPort device, but it is a limitation and I hope they'll update their descriptions accordingly.

The other reasons for 4 rather than 5 stars: the surface of the device is very slick. It tends to slide around (and sometimes, onto the floor). I wrapped a heavy rubber band around the chassis, a high-tech solution that has prevented the thing from sliding off the table. They should provide small stick-on rubber ""feet"" that the user can add as an option. The final 4-not-5-stars reason: the charging ports are a bit too close together. Surely a bit more space could be provided in a future model. All of those things aside the product is clearly of high quality and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another PowerPort model.

[Edited a few hours after posting above review] I have found another device this charger won't charge: the ""Tough Light 400 LR,"" a battery-operated LED camping/emergency light also sold on Amazon. After three hours of connection to the PowerPort, the Tough Light's charging indicator had not moved from red to green. But that should have been enough as the Tough Light arrived with a partial charge. I plugged the light into a standard Samsung charging block — and the battery charge indicator turned green immediately (full charge). The same happened when I plugged the lamp into a no-name/generic USB charging block. So that's two devices the PowerPort can't seem to charge. Disappointing.",4

The charger block that comes with the dock does a great job with charging all the items simultaneously. My nightstand drawer s no longer cluttered with charging cords. I would recommend this charger for charging Apple products. I use this to charge my iPhone 13 pro, Apple Watch 7, EarPods 2 and the Apple Pencil.

12/16 After the latest software update for my wife's Apple Watch 7 (watchOS 8.3), the charger no longer charges her watch. I'm able to charger her watch without any issues on a different charger. My Apple Watch 6 also has the latest software update (8.3). I'm able to charge my Apple Watch 6 on this charger.",5

B01BMDQ9U8,R18KR5A0AVHJYT,Great but.,"Works great! It's so easy and convenient to just place your phone to charge and pick it up to go when you are in a rush. No need to wrestle with the charging cable and port. It was not charging fast at first when I got it, but I changed the case and it works perfect. Keep in mind that the thicker (or in my situation more protective) your phone case is, the slower it will charge.",5

First was surprised the cord is a USB-C, not a USB. it comes with an adapter but everything I have is USB, so I'd have to get a USB-C to a USB adapter. Then I found out the magnetic charger can't hold my iPhone. The only reason I bought it. The ad shows the charger holding a phone horizontal. No way. I paid $36 for this charger but I have a Pure.gear charger that only cost $12. I want my money back.",1

I am updating this review to add that customer service is great. They saw my 1-star review and reached out to me to offer to send a replacement free of charge. The new one works, but is best for plugging in devices overnight when you're not using them, as charge time is slow. We have the two port and three port as well, both of which work.",4

Will order again",5
B00E1UWA4O,R2WB0784JRJZQ2,Great charger that may not work in your car.,"I dearly wanted to give this 5 stars, because by all accounts the charger is fantastic: charges two devices at 2.4 Amps (i.e., fast!) from a single 12V power port.

But there is a big caveat that people should be aware of before buying it: it does not work in all vehicles! (In this particular case, it did not work in an Audi A4)

It's important to understand the source of the problem: there is nothing wrong with the device electronically. Rather, there is a mechanical problem: something about either the shape of the charger or the shape of the car's power ports means that the device does not touch both the positive and negative contacts in the port, so does not establish a circuit, and hence does not deliver power. Other chargers work fine in the car, and the charger works fine in other cars. The particular combination of this charger and this car does not work.

So caveat emptor: as soon as you receive this, make sure it is mechanically compatible with your car's power ports.",3
B08SLRM618,R3J6AV08TNDOVX,"Better than most, but not perfect","PROS: ALL inclusive, NO EXTRA stuff to buy. Plug in power block, connect cord and away you go. Most others need you to ADD/INSERT your Apple watch cable to work, and use the Lightning connector to plug in your AirPods. Neither work for me so these features alone make it a good buy.

CONS: The bad thing I've found its not as fast of a charging unit as compared to other options, EVEN with a higher wattage power block (QC3), but if you ve got the time... haha
1) Let my Apple 6 watch get to about 20-25%, popped it on the charger (only it) and after about 45 min shower/dress it was at 50-55%. Thought that was OK until i used the Apple 1amp charger & cable as a test. Started @ 19% and after the same basic routine, the watch was over 70% charged. 2) iPhone 12 Pro - went from 40% to 65% in about the same time compared to the same Apple 1amp OEM the next day it went up over 40% vs about 25.

All-in-all i'll keep it knowing its not as efficient as other means.",4

B01MSN6329,R1J66Z99JO5TFU,Poor Charging,"I bought this in hopes to minimize all the plugs we needed to charge all of our products.

B01JLXTQ1U,RLYJTDVZEPWL8,Love it!,I love these chargers. They are great behind furniture. I use one port for Apple products and the other for Android and leave both cords in a little cord clip on the end table/nightstand/desk ready to go. I bought one maybe a year ago and it is still going strong so I ordered three more!,5
B082XDGK8J,R1B1FDCIO9CQUJ,Charges fast,"I wasn't too sure about this charger for my Pixel 3XL. I've had wireless chargers that really aren't that fast, unless it's the specific charger made for this phone. Though it doesn't charge as fast as my original fast charger that came with the phone, it charges way faster than any other charger I've used. I definitely recommend this charger.",5
B01BMDQ9U8,R1DXB82XCS4LON,I LOVE wireless charging,"I absolutely love these fast charge wireless chargers. This model is especially handy, since it props the phone up and makes the screen visible when I'm sitting at my desk. I know it's not the most power efficient way to charge my device, but it charges quickly and I don't have to worry about wearing out the connector on my phone. I'd definitely recommend this device to others.",5
B09HH5L434,R20AX3ILOFGRN7,Great charger!,"Great charging product. Chord coils to a good length. I wish the length closest to the charger was longer and not coiled, because of the location of my port to where my phone sits, but it isn't a problem.",5

B088D5VTYV,R1A7KDFSUTV7YX,Exactly as advertised,"I really like this charging station. I was able to get rid of 5 different chargers by using this. The only thing I don't like is having to take off my phone case due to the metal in my phone ring, but it's really not that big of a deal.

Just after 2 months it starts to over heat if im using it and you most DEFINITELY can’t ever use both ports at the same time. It like short wires and then neither one of them works. You'll have to unplug everything and wait for it to want to work again. Sometimes the whole thing just like frizzes up and you gotta wait for it to work.

B08JYH992T,RNZCUCV7QUM3A,Child safety,"This charger is pretty much dummy proof, it’s slick and classy. I have an Otterbox defender series on my iPhone 8 Plus and that’s where it won me over, this wireless charger manages to charge my phone without the need to remove my case. The only downside to this product is that it lacks the wall socket charger but that’s no biggie since I used my original charger which I assume saves me a few $$$ for having to pay for something I already have.
I was so impressed with this charger that I ordered 3 more for all my family to include my 5 year old. The lights on the top plate of the wireless charger are very easy to read for my toddler and even she knows now if the phone is placed correctly and charging or if it needs adjustment.
Another big plus is the safety of my daughter not having to need to handle any wires to charge or disconnect our phones for her when she decides to jack up our data all day in the road (not that I let her plug in my phone but having to stop to attend my 5 year old is a demanding job especially if the phones dying).

B082SNLZ1M,R5EPJH582L2JN,"When it worked it was great,",STOPPED working after 5 months.,2
B09NDGX3QN,RVVNZXPT7VMSS,"Practical, Convenient & Reliable","It is the best charging station. Have not had any problems charging all products. As I have the 12 mini, I have to place it horizontally, but not a big deal. It still serves its purpose. Contrary to other stations, the Apple Watch sits perfectly and charges without any problem. I use it as an old fashion alarm clock. I just touch my phone or watch’s screen and can see the time and snooze my alarm. Very happy with the purchase.",5
B096L5YCJR,R39HW8B4HNCCH9,Works well with iPhone 13 Pro,"Don’t get all the complaints. Either people don’t know how to use this or are just ignorant. You have to use a MagSafe compatible case, not just any kind of case, with the MagSafe chargers or charge the phone naked. Once you do, the attachment is strong and it holds in place. The base can use little more weight but not a dealbreaker. Also the phone doesn’t heat up too much for a 7.5 W charger.",5
B0172QQNBY,R2LFZHGVMZLG7T,Five Stars,Works well. Just as described.,5
B09WK1HWFR,R2ND99D6PE5EH2,This is the greatest product I have ever purchased,"I love this wireless charger, the price is awesome, the magnetic connection to my iphone 13 is superb, I cannot tell you how much I love this product. I love the blue color to match my iphone!",5
B086SM2KWH,RPBX29BURVG3W,great for almost 1 year,"Would give more stars if it lasted the whole year.
Almost made it to a year but then it gave out. Now it flashes twice and doesn't charge. :(
I have tried different power sources (wall/power brick/powered usb port) but no luck.",3

B098TH7KN8,R1VMDUNMVUDXR9,Great product that comes with both the plug and the cord,"I've been happy and surprised with the general quality of this product especially given the value. I was happy that this fast lightning charger came with both a plug and a long cable. Most other products at comparable prices might only come with one of the two. I've also been happy with the blazing speed that it charges my iPhone XS! Though it's an older phone, it's still able to utilize the faster charging capabilities.",5
B0795D7KBD,R3NII5JU0PTQUR,A Good Fit,I use retractable usb and aux cords that routinely pop out of the ports when I tug on them. It's no help that the space where they plug in barely accommodates my hand and it's nearly impossible to see in there. So this charger is a snug fit and I no longer have to twist myself into a pretzel to constantly reattach cords. I thank you and so does my chiropractor.,5
B092VMDYL9,R1QY4MWHXN15HU,Good-looking charger!,Great product. Easy to use and looks good on my desk,5

B08DR7LYB2,R1KKV4HZVMEV0F,Bad Quality Item,"These did not last long, each one overheated after months of use and actually melted my charger cord. Definitely a fire hazard.",1
B08138GVMH,R35FMOY4JM03IO,it does not get hot like the plastic types,"It's a great product , it charges real quickly. The LED is bright enough for day time .",5
B07CNFM87G,RN8V5IQ20U3RL,Perfect for my application,I wanted something small with multiple ports to charge a pair of Bluetooth speakers in my pool house. The additional port is just perfect as I can charge a phone at the same time. It's great when people are over and ask if they can charge somewhere. I keep 2 C and a micro USB at the ready all the time.,5
B09N988M1T,R8Z0ERLBUZOAV,Great product but didn’t work with Otterbox Case,Worked great without the case. Unfortunately needed to return the product.,5

B07THHQMHM,R1TOPTPYYS7UDO,Not as advertised (but made up for it),"I have an iPhone 11 and it charges very slow at 5w and not 7.5w as advertised.

After leaving this review anker contacted me and agreed the puck will only charge at 5w and offered to send me a new upgraded version that charges at 7.5w. Even though it is a stand up charger and not a puck charger I am very happy with it and my phone charges fast. Thank you anker!! 5 star!",2
B08PSR4R37,R39AXWMFF9OF6Q,Works as advertised!,Works perfectly for the S21 Plus and Note 10 Plus! Well built using high quality material. Quick charging power and does heat up. It's now my main charger and also plan to keep it with me whenever I go: perfect for travelling!!! This charger now sits in my shoulder sling bag and is used frequently by friends and family alike!,5
B0795DJXNH,R2GPBGTBDXSVHU,Love the slim profile!,"Perfect. I was looking for something to match all the dash lighting in my car is red and blue. The slim, sleek profile is sleek, unlike a lot of other bulky chargers.",5

B09P176RB9,R2DVMKU7ZHCLRT,Great way to clean up my desk!,"I got this charging station for my wife. She really enjoyed the fact that she could get rid of all the cables that were on her desk. The station is durable and she appreciates the minimal design.
Her only complaint is that she has to remove the bottom half of the case on her AirPods to get them to dock properly.",4
B07P999H4J,R1JDESWL5NNMQ9,Watch for sweet spot,If phone isn't on charger at a certain center spot it pauses charging. Very annoying. Otherwise would have given 4 or 5 stars.,3

B08K32X3X1,R3NEFPNXQTLJRL,Super fast!,I love this charger. It is super fast and reliable. I do find that it does get slightly warm though but it doesn't hamper the charge.,5
B09B3MTXFL,RL6R4GLT6342C,Just buy it,This product was exactly as described. I’m always losing these and in need of new ones and I will definitely be purchasing from them again! Very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to everyone!,5
B01IPJX2NY,R2245SLZO9LDGQ,looks like the original,"The charger I ordered, looks like the original, but it is not, it is not what the product description says, it does not charge fast, it is very slow, it is not original, you are a scammer.",1
B08J49THFB,R4STU013IWQB5,Didn't work for S21,Mine did not light up when charging also would not support fast charge on my Samsung s21. Wasted my money.,1
B08Z347SKL,R2KP97RB1L3JJY,Exactly just what my youngest GS desired for his 16th birthday!,"It's not very often that we grandparents literally ""hit the nail on the head"" as the old saying goes.

B098F7Q9KZ,R1SHQYDHIW99JM,That it dies exactly what it suppose to do,Definitely worth every penny,5

B07GKRR4JH,R36B2MOCFWOUZF,Extremely High Quality!,Perfect for the back seat phone charger,5
B08PV28DZY,R2QPYQUB5PXMI8,"Lightweight, slim profile","This is a nice-looking car charger. It glows blue when it's charging. The slots for both USB and USB-C are super convenient. It's in my car right now, but my primary use will be when I go on a boat.",5
B092VTZT3W,R11RB3547YKN70,Need a strong 💪 QC USB / USB C,Well after going through a few chargers for my car I was about to just give up. I needed something sturdy and is simple to remove after use. This charger was the answer and it's QC. I love the quality and how snug my cables fit into the charger and it doesn't feel like it will become loose either after several uses. Thank you so much for producing a inexpensive quality piece of art.,5
B07Z3KQ4LQ,RMD8NFZCQPB8P,No charge,Order twice. Both times the electrical chargers that go into the wall did not conduct any electricity to the cords,1

B07GPJP8ZC,R270GHN026HY1V,More for the money,Chargers my iPhone and the charger attached at the same time. I have one at work and the other on my nightstand. Best purchase I’ve made. Two for the price of one. 👍🏽,5

B085CDGMG2,R2782ZXB5B8RG3,"Takes up little space to charge the devices I need, but the lights are annoying","It's great because it's a small device with a single cable, so it's clean and doesn't take a lot of room on my desk. It charges all 3 devices just fine simultaneously, although placement of the AirPods is a bit awkward because I have to reach around to the back. The plan was to get another one for my bedside, but the lights are too bright such that they have to be covered at night, so that was a deal breaker. I ended up buying another one anyway for the kitchen counter, though.",4
B08KDM7LPK,R1F2WH3I3HBI05,Pretty Sturdy,I thought these chargers were pretty sturdy. The price is very reasonable.,5
B07L1N7RG8,RFK3HP73C82VO,love these,"this is great for ppl like me who carry a lot of devices all day. I can charge my bose headphones, phone and ipad with one charging block. love this so much",5
B08WWSCCZ4,R11AYFF1GVQDX0,the usbc port stopped working,"The charger was great until like a month after using it, the usbc port just stopped working, but the usba port still works for some reason. And no, it's not the charger I used the charger with a different plug and it still worked.",1
B08K8DNVB4,R1V3OMXPEGLI5A,It’s a very good charger,It works great with some cases but doesn’t work with otterbox cases,4
B07Z3KQ4LQ,R2FD6YBPMQ1LV0,Great value and product,Works as described. I love that I can fast charge both of our phones at the same time from the same outlet. I have have one cord in the car and two inside and an extra block.,5
B07V4DB1Q8,R150XZDA3TNN6W,Works great with LG Velvet 5G,"Great little charging pad. The unit is definitely made in China, but seems to be very solidly constructed. Also, not sure if it is QI certified. Opened it up, plugged it in and it just worked. The charging power seems to be about the same as if it were plugged in via USB-C! I have an LG Velvet 5G phone and just used the AC adapter charging block that came with my phone. Make sure you have the phone placed on the pad in the correct position to work.",5
B09GFR7NSK,R2ZMXU4PJ2OSGD,We love the charger,We love how quick and reliable the charger is.,5
B07C4M5P5S,R1MYGE5054E9F,Doesn’t Live Up To The Buzz,"I’ll keep this short.

Can’t use my phone and have it charge simultaneously but that’s not a fault of the device. Simply, it limits the scenarios you can use your phone in by one.

Sometimes it doesn’t charge until you move your phone around into the right spot. I woke up one morning at five percent because I didn’t place it exactly right.

It’s slow. Not slow, slow but it seems slower than my wired charge or maybe the same. I was expecting a faster charge for some reason.

I haven’t used it in over a month and that speaks for itself. It’s just not as convenient as it could be. If it charged my phone super fast that would be cool but it just doesn’t beat a wire.

I’d give it less stars but my qualms are mostly preference. It does what it is supposed to and if my issues don’t concern you, at this price, I wouldn’t dissuade you.",3
B08RHVBVRL,R2IMXDVAUQ4HYX,Works!,Works great and doesn’t take up a lot of space!,5
B077XQF8N7,R2C17MXDU91QUD,Not fast/quick charge,"We bought this for our 2 fast charge usb-c's. Doesn't fast charge using these adapters, but if we use the usb-c on our old fast charge adapters, it fast charges. So it isn't the usb-c being an issue, it's this adapter. Very disappointing.",5
B07R7K2QMW,R1EB5EM3BCHYXI,Didn't work out of the box,"I just purchased two of these to eliminate taking my charger to my office and around my house. Neither one worked. Very disappointing. I tried them with multiple cables and multiple outlets, it's definitely the product. Returning them today.",1

B09JYL9YYX,R362KZI3OX8GKD,Great Product,"The charger was easy to set up.

Very inconvenient and deceitful",2
B08163NPFD,R7KEHK4Q9FTQA,This is an awesome alarm clock for its features,"I had a clock radio with very fuzzy radio reception and paid $20.00 for it on Amazon. Don't get me wrong, it had an awesome alarm to wake up to (since I have a morning job). The clock radio also had LED display on 4 settings and a dim switch with a built in USB port. I thought I had a nice alarm clock with USB extention, until I found the alarm clock I recently bought.

The alarm clock from LaCrosse Technologies is amazing: LED display, dimmable setting and a built in USB port. It doesn't have a radio which is no problem for me, but it does have a feature that I really enjoy. The clock reflects off my wall, so I don't have to turn my head to see what time it is; I just look at the ceeling.

The dock station for my Iphone 8 is really nice to have. All I do is turn my phone to silent mode (still on) and put it in the dock station to charge over night. That way, I'm not bombarded with noises going off from my phone. In the morning, it's charged and ready to go for the day ahead of me. I really like this.

In all this alarm radio is really nice. I would recommend it to a friend in two seconds for the features it gives and the price. Its really nice and will last a while, if taken care of well which isn't a problem for me.",5

B091HWJJ1M,R2RTV36NAPUSRB,Picky with what it will charge,I like anker chargers and have a few but this one seams to be flakey with what devices it will charge. Only one out of four devices I tried would charge and even then I would have to unplug and plug back in multiple times before it would work. When it was charging it also got very hot. You should consider one of their other chargers and pass on this one.,3

B0876VQHP7,R3LZWWLHWZIH8D,Great Compact Fast Charger for the Price.,It works like a current fast charger would work. Using the current Qualcomm quick charge 3 standard for both ports it will top up any device that can fast charge just like the stock power brick. It's small and compact which makes it easy to carry around as well. Would highly recommend if you have an Samsung or Apple device within the last 4 or 5 year so you can take advantage of the fast charge feature.,5

I don't know why they don't offer more chargers with Qualcomm 3.0. because of this I've mainly been buying Aukey, which seem to have the best selection of 3.0 chargers.

Edit 5/17/15: I have noticed that the usb cord isn't high speed! It takes my android devices 4+ hours to charge with this usb. I got another USB cord from Anker and only needed 2-3hrs max to charge from dead.

On another note, if you don't like bright lights and the charger will be in your room where you sleep, beware. It's very, very bright.",1
B083DLKFRR,R27W1UTHEFTJZI,Good while it lasted.,"Worked great while it lasted, but already stopped working. The USB-C to USB-C cord was a little annoying at first b/c my car charging adapter is the other style of USB, as is the built in charging port on my desk at work, but for regular plug-in charging it was fast and worked as expected. Then it just died a few days ago. Went to charge my phone and - nothing. No physical damage to the cord or brick, my other charging cord still works fine so not an issue with the phone, it just stopped working. Kind of a bummer since the whole reason I ordered it was b/c I was sick of the ""drugstore"" cords that die after a month. But still good for the money, I suppose.",3

B08P544KWF,R32QGHVJKV2HM5,This thing is FAST,"I don't write a ton of reviews, but this compelled me to mention it for those who are curious if it's really worth the money. It absolutely IS! The charge time using this charger with my iPhone X vs the ""standard"" chargers are night and day. I compared it using a Apple cable with a 5w 2.4ma charger and it wasn't even close. The Anker Nano Charger took my phone from 20% to 90% in less than an hour. For people like me who often need not only to charge their phone, but do it quickly... this is a no-brainer. If you are looking for something that can power two devices at the same time, look for the dual charger here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M9M2V7X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

B01N68AMCU,R3V30SFJHYV4L6,Potential fire hazard,The look of the product is good. Shipping was fast. My biggest problem is my daughter had this plugged in her room to charge her phone. While she was asleep we noticed this awful noise coming from her room. At further investigation we discovered the noise was coming from the charging box. We unplugged it and it was HOT to the touch. My husband almost burnt his hand on it. The noise continued for a little while even after it was unplugged. I threw it in the garbage. I’m thankful we noticed the noise because it could have started a fire in her bedroom. I will not be using the remaining charging boxes for fear the will cause a fire. I would have returned them since I only just purchased them around Christmas but the return window has closed so I’m going to throw them away.,1

Unfortunately I threw away the packaging after a couple days, so I don't expect to be able to return it and am out the money I paid for it. I don't know if I just got a bad one but I certainly can't continue to use it safely because I am afraid the extreme heat means something isn't working properly in the circuits and I don't want to destroy my phone or worse.",1

B082GBHYVX,R162LXYY6DUTUT,I like my Quezqa Wireless Charger,"I use it to charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max and my Apple Watch. I like that it is small and good looking and works well. There are two lights that flash for twenty seconds, one for the watch and one fo the phone, to let you know that charging has started. I found that if the phone is not positioned exactly correct on the charger, the light continues to flash.

I would prefer that the lights were much smaller and less bright and would slowly pulse rather than blink. I would like the light to continue to pulse until charging stops. That dull pulsing light would not annoy me.

Perhaps it is not necessary for a light to pulse until charging stops because the device will stop accepting a charge when it has had enough. But.... you asked my opinion.",5

First off it is not fast charging, it takes over 3 hrs to fully charge, second, even though the green light turns on, it does not always start charging. I dont know if that is because I have a case on my phone or what, but it has happened numerous times that I have put my phone on the charger, the light flashes green so I think its good to go, but after a couple hrs I come to see it has not been charging at all and I have to rearrange it to have it start charging.

I recommended it to all my friends. Unfortunately, months later it simply just stopped working. Now, it is useless. The fast-charging port is slow as molasses. Last night I plugged my phone into the fast charging port because it was at 33%. Over two hours later, I check on it and it wasn’t even at 90% yet! How is that possible?!?

Love the lights for plugging in in the evening.,5

So nice, I bought another for the misses.. She too loves it.. I can't think of a stronger recommendation for a product than buying a second one..

I did find one curiosity about it though.. I have powered by a multi port USB power source which has a display showing how much current a given port is drawing.. I notice once the phone is picked up off of the charger, I see the current to the charger, bounce back and forth every few seconds between zero and a few milliamps of current.. flk k",5

EDITED: I have bumped this up to a 5 star product for many reasons. right after my review they reached out to me to solve my problem! They were so nice and so helpful! And!

B089D265S8,R2GYAUKUPX7ZOZ,Phone piece doesn’t charge,My daughter got a case with a pop it attached so we thought the unit wouldn’t charge because of that. Unfortunately we found out months later that the phone charging piece doesn’t work at all. She changed her case to a slim case and it still won’t charge. Bummed we are out of our return time frame.,1
B09HZBN2MJ,R23IAGRO3LZGKZ,Fast charge absolutely worth the money,MUST HAVE! Great charger and so helpful! The charging port on my phone was not working well the connection was intermittent. Not having to use the regular cord and charging port spending forever trying to get it to connect so it would charge drove me crazy being relieved of this frustration is extremely helpful. I’ve been late to work because my phone would stop charging in the middle of the night and turn off so I had no alarm. Such small things caused a lot of stress. Another plus I love being able to charge my AirPods at the same time. Not sure if I’m imagining it but I swear the charging seems to be much much faster than a regular cord charge. I’m purchasing more for the other rooms of my house.,5

B09N9CSBC9,RTBLK10FXDQ76,Fits like it came with the car,"My car has covers over the power sockets and this allows me to close them as though it wasn't even there. I rarely do this because something is always plugged into them, but it's a great feature anyway. I haven't rated durability because it hasn't been in use long enough to warrant that. My only current dislike is that although it has a flip out handle for ease of removal, flipping out the handle is NOT easy. It's a small dislike because the use case for this item is ""put it in and leave it in"", so needing a toothpick at removal time won't be an everyday thing.",5

Keep in mind that you have to provide your own watch charger, but it has the spot to put it in, and plug it in, so it doesn’t take up another outlet spot. You can use just the phone charger by itself, for less bulk, or attach the AirPods/watch charger to the side, magnetized to stay together. Perfect all in one, especially for travel!",5

B08LVSFN4X,R1TZWMCQW2B2TK,Misleading Product Title,I purchased this because it said WIRELESS CHARGER. It is NOT wireless. It needs to stay plugged in at all times to work. So this was a bait and switch. Terrible! To make matters worse it doesn’t even stay charging!! Complete junk!,1
B01IUTIUEA,R2PUCBUL9NWHNP,Great For Just About Everything,"I got this to charge the variety of electronics I usually have lying around. I have an iPhone that I use for applications, my 3DS, a Microsoft Band, and a bunch of other things I usually can't find spare USB ports for all the time. This gets the job done quite easily, since it has a mass of plugs ready to go. I can see this working quite well for hotel rooms that have limited outlets (and if you don't feel like packing a powerstrip).

I dinged it a star because it wasn't compatible with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Originally, I thought maybe the Switch Pro Controller was similar to the PS3 controller, where it's required that the controller does a handshake with the USB port before allowing a charge to occur (hence why most common USB outlets fail for the PS3 controller). But, after plugging the Switch Pro Controller into a standard USB to Wall outlet adapter, it charged just find. Thus, I didn't really see a reason as to why the Anker product couldn't do it (had it been similar to the PS3 controller, I would have easily understood why). I tried it in every port, but nothing worked.",4
B091GCXYFP,R1SBZSODLY4Z9A,Open Box,"I got a used one even though a paid for a new one. Box was open and there is visible wear and tear.

Update: It isn’t lightning speed like claimed. Takes 5 hours to charge completely.",1
B08J49THFB,R29GSNYWCV4CRX,Great little low-profile charger,"I got this to use with my QI-compatible mouse, had it for a few weeks now and it works just fine. It gets a wee bit warm but I think that's normal for QI charging, it never gets hot enough to be of concern. Build quality is excellent, and this one came with a Type C cable, which I wasn't expecting (from what I can remember of the images when I bought it, I thought it was Micro USB). It's nice because I happen to have a lot more Type C cables than anything else at this point.

The light ring is nice as well, it's solid green when nothing is charging, blue while charging, and flashes between cyan and blue when the position needs to be adjusted so the device will charge properly. As far as I can tell the lights don't ever turn off, might be annoying on the bedside table but since this lives on my desk I don't really mind, I can clearly see when it has power just by glancing at it.

Last thing about it is charging speed, I don't really have much experience with QI and none of my devices support it, with the exception of my mouse (what I got it for) and one pair of TWS headphones. I have no idea what the rated QI speeds for either of these are, but what I do know is that it is a bit slow, especially compared to the Type C supercharging speeds I'm used to. The mouse normally should take 2 hours to charge fully over Type C, when I use this QI pad it takes about 2 hours to charge 5-10%. Might be the mouse, who knows, I don't really care because I leave it to top-up charge overnight. Just something to keep in mind.",5

I ended up grabbing it since I also purchased the Tozo T6 wireless earbuds and didn't feel like plugging them in to charge the battery. I also have an iPhone 8 Plus and it works like a charm with the W1. Just make sure you get a wall socket adapter to ensure the W1 has the proper amount of power feeding to it for phone charging.

Be aware that this isn't going to charge your phone as fast as plugging it into a wall socket power, but it's still pretty reasonable if you're not in a rush. I got the Anker Quick Charge 3.0, 18W 3Amp USB Wall Charger.",5

B07L1KJV35,R1WHMYZ3W48VKN,Inexpensive & efficient,"When every member of the household has two devices (at minimum), it’s extremely efficient to have these chargers that handle two devices at the same time.

B06XXZK99F,RLU2TC8H56EF0,Love this charger!!!,"As cells sometimes do, we have 2 phones in our household that don't have working charging ports so this is the ideal solution. I bought one first for myself, then my daughter started eyeballing it so I bought her one in a different color. Of course now my husband wants one so soon we shall most likely have them all around the house, but they're great as they take up little space due to being in a standing position, they fast charge so long as you use the charging block that is meant for your fast charging phone and the light on them that signals complete charge is awesome! Money well spent.",5
B09GFR7NSK,R10NU3G0NO4MR7,Works perfectly,This charger is exactly what I needed as a backup for my 16 inch Macbook Pro. The cable and charging block works just as needed for charging your laptop. 100 watts for power works great to have your laptop charged while using. This product is great for the price and you wont be disappointed.,5
B00VH8ENXE,RM8TOW0L0XY2T,Best Portable Charger,"I've been a user of Anker products for well over a year now. I've purchased a few 5 port chargers that have an external power cable, a wireless charger, and several versions of their micro USB cables. Typically I have carried in my work bag and on trips one of their 5 port chargers with an additional cabled that plugs it into the wall. I loved this, as I used one at home as well. However, recently I have been cleaning out my work bag both trying to make it weigh less and get rid of the clutter. So, for work I had purchased a few two port wall chargers and then found this charger, so I thought it would free up some room, being I would not have to haul around another cable for it.

Got it in the mail the other day and so far I love it. The form factor is super small and having the ability to flip the plug portion into the box is very nice, reminds me of an Apple charger in that aspect. All the USB plugs look great and hold the cords firmly inside. I also love the status light, which is a feature missing from my other Anker chargers. Is is solid blue when everything is done charging and green while charging.

Pros:
- Small form factor makes it great for traveling
- Fold in plug insures the prongs won't get damaged and won't damage other things in your bag
- Status light is great for knowing when your devices are done charging, ideal for a hotel room if you are charging at a desk
- Seems like a high quality build as well

Cons:
- As of right now I don't have any, other than it is 4 ports, not 5 like the other Anker units I have

If you are looking for a great charger to take on the go, you can't go wrong with this. If I run into any issues down the road, I will for sure update my review to reflect those.",5
B088RDWBBL,RP55GCHWW3OQ8,Great charger platform,"Nice compact charger platform for all your needs. I got iPhone 11 Pro , iWatch 5 and AirPods Pro . I can charge all of them with that charger platform at same time. Charging platform for phone is adjustable, it’s can lay flat or can be put up at the angle, so you can use it as stand, charging you phone in vertical or horizontal position. And using it with fast charger you got that fast charging capability.",5

Anker bundle è la soluzione adatta per chi desidera un caricatore wireless funzionale, esteticamente gradevole e vuole contenere le spese.
L'unica pecca, che è probabilmente qualcosa di soggettivo che moltissimi non considereranno minimamente negativo, è la spia di ricarica in corso, che rimane costantemente accesa generando un barlume blu che potrebbe dare fastidio durante la notte.
Ribadisco la soggettività di questo punto, ma ritengo giusto specificarlo per chi come me ha bisogno del bui completo per dormire serenamente.

product is inferior. Buyer Beware",1
B077XQJ2FK,R2M1YUC2FDSJVM,Great for travel,We went on vacation to the Dominican Republic and we were always in need of more outlets. Luckily I could charge two devices in one with these.

So clearly it's just not compatible with my phone/case combination.

This was perfect! I initially bought it for my desk at work, wanting something I could leave on the desk that would hold my phone upright, so I could see it. I loved it so much that I bought three more for home; one I leave on the kitchen counter, one on the desk in my home office, and one on my bedside table.

I had read the reviews of this one and a few other similar items and read that while this was rather inexpensive, the quality was superior to some that cost more.

Love it!",5

B071WYF9HP,R1X9VBRJ9JBSEV,🔌🌩️ PowerIQ 2.0 is all we need... with the addition of PD,"Also buy the one other  Anker PowerIQ 2.0 device: wall charger . It closely emulates the many other fasterness charging protocols including Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0. (Not yet QuickCharge 4.0, but I do not doubt PowerIQ 3.0 will be including the planned voltages currently disabled in firmware for PowerIQ 2.0. Read between the PressRelease lines.).

⚡ The iPhone users who travel with me appreciate the PD. For the older-iphone people I keep a usb A lightnight cable. Everyone else benefits from the other two of these car chargers in the car.

⚡ I await multiple PowerIQ 2.0 ports in a single car charger.

⚡ My  MakerHawk USB power tester  approves of Anker claims of awesomeness

buy:  Anker Powerline+ II Lightning Cable (6ft), MFi Certified . I use red for  USB C to C , and  A to micro , so Gold for iphone.

Please don't buy any of the cheap fake-certified PD cables or USB C to lightning cables on amazon; wait for anker versions of these.

I have retired the  anker 42Watt 2-port QC3/IQ1 car charger  as a hand-me-down.

Only one Anker device has ever failed on me. A powerbank ( Anker PowerCore+ 10050 ) used a few times before being lost for a few years (then found).

For my purchased out of pocket phones (to keep vzw grandfathered unlimited data) I trust only Anker charging devices.",5

B08TWWRQGB,R2X98SF6DW8TKJ,Waste of Money,I bought two of these because of the high reviews. I tried them on two phones-one that has a slightly thicker case and one with a thinner case.

B08PSNPT5J,R27WRF0LGB1U50,Ausprobiert und getestet mit Samsung S21 Ultra + S20 FE 👍,"Spigen Produkte müssen sich vor den originalen der Hersteller, weder in Qualität noch Funktionalität, verstecken. Und auch das Spigen ArcField 15W Wireless Charging Pad macht da keine Ausnahme und präsentiert sich schick, sowie auch hervorragend verarbeitet. Ich mag zwar eher weißes Zubehör, einfach weil man da den Staub nicht so schnell sieht, aber trotzdem gefällt mir das Design und die Farbe vom Spigen Lade-Pad. Es wirkt fast schon edel und da die meisten in Deutschland verkauften Smartphones eh schwarz sind, passt das ganze auch irgendwie 😁
Einzig die großzügig Gummierung, welche verhindern soll dass euch das Smartphone abschmiert wenn es mit Vibrationsalarm auf dem Pad klingelt, die stört mich etwas, weil die Gummierung halt Staub anzieht und schlecht sauber machen lässt sich das auch 😬

➡️ Funktionstest…

Mein Samsung S21 Ultra zeigt auf dem Spigen Pad die identische Zeit bis zur vollständigen Aufladung an wie auf dem Samsung Wireless Charger Pad EP-P1300T.
Beim S20 FE meiner Partnerin die identische Situation, die Ladezeit ist auf die Minute gleich. Da scheinen die Ingenieure von Spigen gute Arbeit geleistet zu haben und es entstehen bei der Nutzung keinerlei Nachteile gegenüber original Zubehör.
Bei der Nutzung ist keine ungewöhnliche Wärmeentwicklung feststellbar und auch kein fiepen oder andere Geräusche.

Als Stromversorgung nutze ich übrigens ein Samsung 15W Netzteil, aber sicherlich funktioniert das mit jedem anderen Netzteil und passenden Kabel auch. Wer jetzt denkt, 15W Netzteil, das ist doch Käse, da muss was mit richtig Power dran, klar, kann man machen, bringt nur nichts, weil das Smartphone die Ladeenergie regelt und wenn das zb. nur Wireless Charging mit 9W unterstützt, dann könnt ihr als Netzteil dranhängen was ihr wollt, es geht trotzdem nicht schneller. Ach so, dass Spigen Ladepad hat als maximale Leistungsabgabe beim Laden 15W.

Wer das, dem Spigen Lade-Pad beiliegende (USB-C auf USB-C) Kabel nutzen will, braucht ein Netzteil mit USB-C Ausgang, zb. das  Spigen 20W USB-C Netzteil .

➡️ Resümee…

Auch wenn sich leider kein Netzteil im Lieferumfang befindet und dadurch der Preisvorteil etwas schwindet, so bietet das Spigen Wireless Charging Pad in Qualität und Funktionalität eine echte Alternative zum original Zubehör der Smartphone Hersteller.",5

B07THC5DJV,R3U1NE8X77AYIM,Poor build quality and unsafe. Not UL listed. Avoid.,"I bought this charger so I could charge my laptop, phone, and few other misc. usb devices. Initially I was impressed with the features for the price, but shortly after using it I changed my mind. Every single time that I plugged the charger in it would make a large spark. Now I am not talking about a regular old spark that you see when you plug something in, I am talking a BIG SPARK, as in a I-am-not-comfortable-with-this kind of spark. I shrugged it off initially as nothing, but after repeated plugging in, it happened every time.

After plugging all of my devices in, everything seemed to charge normally, but I notice very strange issues with some of my devices while they were plugged in. My laptop's trackpad behaved erratically and my phone's touch screen didn't work properly. The laptop's trackpad would only work if i did not rest my hand on the laptop at all when I used it, and my phone's screen would not work properly at all regardless of how I interacted with it. I researched this issue online and some people said that this issue was likely due to a bad ground on whatever power adapter I was using. Sure enough when I used another power adapter, the issue cleared up on both my phone and my laptop.

So in the end I returned the charger due to the abnormally large spark it created when plugging it in and the grounding issue that caused my laptop and phone to behave strangely. It should be noted that the charger is not UL certified, so if you do purchase it, be aware of the risk of using a non-UL certified device.",1

B07FJZDGL5,R11FPY5GRD8YEH,Useless warranty; useless (and/or dangerous) charger,"This charger worked well for about 6 months with relatively few issues.

Recently (last 1-2 months), the charger either 1) doesn't charge my Galaxy Watch at all; 2) rapidly kills my battery (i.e., start at 60% and within an hour, it'll be at 25% when it should've been closer to 90%); or 3) charges my battery slowly, but overheats my battery to the point where it'd scald my skin if I put it on immediately.

I figured this would be something simple to get serviced and/or replaced, but going through the Samsung warranty site is absurdly difficult. I try creating a service order only to find 'no service locations' near me despite being in a dense metro area.

I've tried talking to an online chat representative, but never get connected to an agent despite trying to on two different computers on different browsers.

If your unit works great, then awesome. Otherwise this is a pain and a waste of a lot of money. I've had to resort back to using my original chargers for my Note 9 and Galaxy Watch since those have been far more robust when needed.",1

A station that actually works well and you don’t have to use your own cables, it comes with everything included that you need. It charges fast. And the design being foldable makes it very easy to travel with.",5
B07DBXZZN3,R2YMAI1S8NN0RO,Excellent for home and work,"This thing is great! I can set it next to my bed and see the time and charge concurrently. If you use an ""alarm clock"" style app and need a charger, this is your one-stop solution. I have since removed my alarm clock from my night stand and have gotten back space (for the baby monitor and my kindle, but that's a different story). I loved it so much at home that I got another for work. I have this situated between my two monitors and can very easily charge my work phone and see who is calling. If I have a conference call or Teams meeting, this is a DREAM. I am so happy with this purchase and cannot recommend it enough. Pair it with some bluetooth ear buds for a fabulous wire-free experience.",5
B09KH3Z9MF,R65HRFQRPVYHT,DO NOT BUY!,We bought 2 for our phones and Series 7 apple watches. Took 8 hours to charge the phone and did not charge the watches at all even know the watch did react like it was being charged. Waste of Money. Would not recommend.,1
B07Y36PSH5,RO8CCBTW8G0VN,"Feels solid, fast charging for Pixel phone","I'm usually skeptical about buying a less-known brand for phone accessories, however this particular product isn't very common. I am happy with this wall charger. It feels well made and all of the plugs/ports are snug. The most important thing about this is that I can use it for my watch charger (USB-A) and my Pixel 3 (USB-C 18w). The only downside is that the wall plug doesn't fold in, but it still gets 5 stars in my book for feeling well made and doing what it's supposed to.

I will update this post over time if I experience any issues.",5
B088RDWBBL,R2AAS8RSTJWV0Q,Best value for the money with this one!,I bought two different charging stands for Xmas & this one was the best. You only need one plug to charge everything on this stand.

B089G6RM6Z,RFX8T2I4LSUHH,Best 3-device charge design!,"This is the best design of the multiple 3-in-1 charges due to its ability to lie flat and pack away, making it really easy to travel with (where outlets are often scarce... this allows you to do your Apple Watch, phone and either AirPods or another phone). I also really like how the charge light indicators are very subtle so it doesn’t bother you on your nightstand when sleeping. Plus it comes with the actual outlet charger as well. Great product!",5

B07GW9S9TB,R2VPB1B9X78CD7,"Works great, especially when charging port fails",We have a phone in our family that is being finicky about charging with a cord. This is a great solution. To the disappointment of the phone owner that a new phone wasn't the solution :-) This product stops charging when device is at full battery as well.,5
B07FM8R7J1,R29L8F4MO2KR9D,UPDATED Very satisfied.,"UPDATE: Tozo contacted me and sent me a free replacement that works great. Added two stars. Very satisfied, still find the bright LEDs vaguely annoying but I’m good at positioning my phone perfectly to cover them.

I am using the Tozo with an iPhone 8+ to charge it at night, plugged into a quick charge USB plug.

Every night I have to unplug the Tozo and plug it back in to get it to charge my phone, basically negating it’s purpose of me just setting my phone on it and going to sleep. I could just plug in my phone instead, and probably will once I get tired of being annoyed by this thing.

Once replugged in it will not charge my phone from under 10% to 100%; it usually stops charging around 70, which if I notice in the night means I have to unplug it and plug it back in again and from there most times it still won’t charge all the way to 100 before stopping.

The LED lights on it are extremely bright. You need to lay your phone on the charger a specific way at night to cover them, which is fine, but if you wake up in the middle of the night, check the time and see you’re charged enough and don’t lay it on the charger, or put it on the charger at an angle, the lights will light up your room.

It does charge without trouble through my SPIGEN case, and using the quick charge USB plug charges it acceptably fast for overnight charging, when it works, which it barely does.",4
B09CGNWY4S,R18RNAMQF8PJCT,Awesome! Good product!,"So glad to get this foldable wireless charger 3-in -1 charging stand, because I am looking for a folding stand to charge my apple watch and my air pods,this really matches the description and perfect, good price, thank you!",5

B082ZY5GXX,R34IAFAYRCPIKN,"Finally, a 'Super Fast Charger' for my S20 Plus",Bought several other brand chargers that claimed to charge my Galaxy S20 Plus at super fast speed but they only got me to fast charging. This one uses the right charging protocols to get me charging at Super Fast Charging speed. As super fast as the wall charger that came with my S20 Plus. Unfortunately I can't get accurate charging specs to share with you because the inline power meter seems to interfere with the charging protocol changing the estimated time to fully charge from 54 minutes to 1 hour and 36 minutes so it must slow it down while the phone will still indicate it's charging at Super Fast Charging speed. I use it on trips to charge my S20 phone at Super Fast while using the 18 volt port to power another S10 at it's maximum charging speed which is only Fast Charging. Feels like a quality product not like the cheap Chinese products. They say it can get hot but mine hasn't even gotten noticeably warm. Exactly what I've been looking for. Thinking of buying a second one for our other car. Using in a 2009 Honda Fit gas powered vehicle so my current and voltage are constant.,5

B09PYHS59Z,R1TPZGU3KTN9O2,Save Your Coins...You've Been Warned,"I should begin by stating that the device was fairly easy to use. That's the only positive thing I have to say about this device.

When I received the wireless charger, I was eager to use it, so I plug it in and place my (caseless) phone in the middle of the charger and it did as the description stated it would do; it lit up for a few seconds and then went dark, the red led light on my phone came on which indicated that it was charging. I busied myself doing something while it charged, so I can't say how long it was on the charger but it was on there long enough for me to think about it. My phone was at 93%; I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't thrilled either because it should have been charged. I placed the phone back on the charger and I looked at how long it stated it would take to fully charge my phone and it said 12 minutes! I could not believe it...12 minutes to get 7%???Nope! I took it off and plugged my wired charger in and it said it would only take 5 minutes to fully chrge! I couldn't do anything except laugh. So I immediately requested to return this piece of useless plastic.

Before I placed the wireless charger back into its box to return it, I gave it one more try. My phone was at 31%; I placed it on the charger and it said it would take well over 2 hrs to fully charge. I took the phone off and plugged my wired charger in and it said it would take a little over an hour. Don't waste your time, energy or coins on this.",1

I thought this would take care of my needs. However, I was wrong. I connected this to the battery, and using the original cord that came with the MacBook, the most i could get was 15 watts at 5 volts, and even that was very unstable. The battery was outputting about 14.4 volts, so I attached a boost converter to increase the voltage to 24V, in case that was the issue. I got no change at all. This product was completly useless for my needs. I instead ordered a nice USB-C PD car charger, ASIN B082ZY5GXX, and just take that apart to mount it in the enclosure.

B08GSDZKPD,R9BYXLHX2DW61,Nice charger but not perfect,"As a Tiny charger for traveling I suppose it’s not bad. However, one thing I have noticed is that if the cables you connect to it at a little tight, they can potentially pull on the charger and have it start pulling out of the socket. Which could possibly be an issue. If you want to plug a couple of cables into it and you have plenty of slack AND you are not looking for any kind of fast charging, then these will do the trick. But I would not plug one of these behind a couch or a table, or anywhere you cannot keep a direct eye on, because of the aforementioned tendency to come out of the plug socket.",3

B096LQK913,R2MO8X69MFJ5KN,A must have,"Play Video
 Smartphones are extremely powerful and capable nowadays, but there is one critical link that can turn a fantastic device into a nuisance - the battery. Even if battery capacity isn't an issue, phones need to charge eventually, and people often overlook the importance of a fast charger and the convenience it brings to the table.
I needed more fast chargers for my house due to getting used to the convenience of having a fast charger to charge my phone, headsets, etc. So, I decided to buy this product, and I found that it works just as well, if not better, than my other fast charging blocks. Great product overall. I will recommend using this product very well.",5
B08QZ8Y9DS,R255NTHVZQ3KCU,Good overall,"Charging for longer is causing the phone to heatup which i have seen in my other wireless charger as well, so nothing concerning here, other than that its good.",5

B09B7FKV8Q,R3EINQSZOW1B4F,READ BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING ELSE,"this is the only three in one charger that has worked for me. I bought this exact brand about two years ago, but I was in search of a new one because it had snapped in half from traveling so much with it, which is why I gave traveling only three stars. It doesn’t fold so it makes it difficult to put in a suitcase or a backpack. Because of that, I was looking for something a little more slim for traveling. Thus, I bought FOUR different brands/chargers before this one. Not a single one worked. Finally I resorted back to the original, and now I have a charger that works for all three Apple products. don’t waste your time or money on any other chargers, just get this one",5
B09PYHS59Z,R36QFKAHKYUOZZ,Money waste,"Doesnt work at all!! I’m so upset that I ended buying it twice. When I saw that the light turns on once you place your phone, I thought it was actually charging, then I put it on my guest room and ordered 2 more for other areas in my house. As I put one in my bedroom to charge my own phone, I saw that it doesnt charge AT ALL. My Iphone X would stay there all night and still show less than 10% battery. I tested the others around the house and same thing. My husband bought him from another brand and it works perfectly. With these, I totally wasted my money.",1
B08JY8BH95,RXI70QHCHFQQG,Needs more instructions,"I wish there was more instructions provided with the item. I had to go to the Amazon reviews to figure out if the lights would be different colors or how I would know if it’s charging. You do have to charge It before you can use it. It does a great job though. Flashes green when it needs to charge, blue when it is charging the phone. Solid green when it’s charging.",4
B0795DJXNH,R34SFK58V9M16Y,Disappointed,"This charger is supposed to be ""flush mount"", which I thought meant that it wouldn't stick out of the charging socket. Maybe because I have only the cigarette lighter socket that might be shorter than in newer cars than mine? Anyway, this charger is not ""flush"" and protrudes a good 3/8""-1/2"", making it lesser than the tight fit i was expecting. Although I bought a ""lightning "" charge cord, I found this duo does not charge any faster than the one I bought from Big Lots at their check-out counter. In fact I've gone back to that set up because it is faster if not as securely fitting as the Ainope.",3

B091J7B6X7,R2EYOSF20W9S1Q,Very nice device - love being able to charge both phone and watch at same time,"I had been looking for a iPhone and iWatch charging station for a few weeks after my wife acquired an iWatch for me. Almost all of the charging stand I came across had the magnetic option for the iwatch, but not for the iphone. Instead, you could snake a puck into the stand, but this just seemed.. well... dumb to me.

Why not just make a stand that had magnetic charging/holders for both?

And then I found this one from Belkin.

It's simple and unobtrusive. It just blends in and you don't notice it at your bedside. It holds both the phone and watch without issue, charging both and keeping them both visible if you elect to use one, or both, as clocks for the night.

I wish they offered a slightly less expensive version which did away with the charger in the base for things like Airpods. But that's nitpicking on my part.

While I was reluctant to make this purchase if only because of the price, I can honestly say it was worth every penny and I'm glad I didn't go with a cheaper solution.",5

The rubberized shaped grips, helps to prevent any errant swishes from pushing my phone around. And of course there are rubberized feet on the bottom as well, it's very stable on my desk. It lights up blue when the phone is placed on the surface, then the smoothie ness of its led lights’s a real nice touch, it flashes for a few seconds when you first set your phone down so you know it’s charging. The connection port is a fast charging USB-C adapter with the proper power supply It will fast charge (which is a piece of cake).

Considering the build quality as well as for the extremely reasonable price I’m glad for decided to buy this TOZO Wireless charger. I can’t hardly wait to buy another one for at home.

UPDATE: After 19 months, all three chargers stopped functioning. One still charges for about one minute until it eventually stops. As an IT professional, I understand nothing lasts forever and we have to account for sustainment and eventual replacement but this is disappointing. If one charger failed, I could accept that, but all three chargers failed within the span of a few weeks. I've already ruled out electrical. They are each on different circuits and protected, not that we've experienced any electrical anomalies in the past few months. I expect a product of this kind to last longer than my smart phone. I can no longer recommend this brand in good conscious.",2

The design on this charger is gorgeous, I love how slim and sleek it is and the different colored LED lights that indict charging/not charging is brilliant. Only reason I deducted a star was because it doesn't charge as fast as I would like, takes about 30 minutes to reach 50%, but that could just be my phone. Overall a great charger at a great price.",4

B01MXM9TSR,R2O0BS5VV89RJ4,**Buyer Beware!!!**,"This is the second USB charging hub I have purchased in 2 years. My first one is currently used for work and is still working, has 3.0 and keeps multiple tablets and phones charged without any issues. I read almost all of the reviews before purchasing, and noticed quite a few had similar issues. After receiving this one for my home use, I plugged it in and hooked a couple phones to it. The android phone screen would come on, then shut off, and come on again as if the cable was loose. I checked the cable and found it to be really hot, burning my finger. The iPhone was the same way, as were the cables. I have never had a charging cable be so hot that it would burn my finger. I immediately unplugged all the phones from the charging cords, and the USB cords from the hub itself. This hub was really hot to the touch so I unplugged it from the wall. Every connection point was burning hot. Luckily this was sitting on a table and not near anything that could potentially catch fire. My charging cords are still good, but this unit will be sent back as I do not trust it. Imagine leaving this overnight, like most people do, and waking up to a burned cable or destroyed phone/tablet. Overall I do not recommend this product.",1

I can only assume they did it to get rid of the dozens of 1-star reviews of this faulty product, because my old review is gone, as are many others. Amazon should ban sellers like this.

The USB C port fails to charge devices, instead flipping on and off so it actually kills the phone by turning the screen on and draining the battery faster than it can charge. It also runs very hot to the touch, which is not a good sign for something that's only dealing with 45 watts.",1

Spigen is a little pricier than some. Yes you can get charger boxes where ever, for cheap. In my opinion that’s a NO! When you are spending ALOT of money on a phone or laptop or anything that needs a charge, the charger and cord matter! You want your electronics to get a proper charger to ensure battery life/function!

Definitely get this charger box! It’s amazing! So worth the price! Charges our phones super fast!

Review updated from 3 to 5 stars:
Anker contacted me directly after I gave it the three star review for crapping out. They sent me a new one gratis with no argument. Pretty uncommon. Review is still the same, now I have one that works! Supposedly the internal breaker scheme has been updated, so looking forward to this one working better. 4 stars for product, one extra star for stellar (pun recognized after fact) service!

I still have some lightning cables that only work in an Apple charger, not on the Anker charger, but one that works on the Anker works on all ports now. Maybe because the lightning cable is a hard to implement spec? The cables tend to be flaky, especially the long ones. Hopefully USB-C will be more reliable.",5

It doesn't quite sit flush in the lighter socket, which is good for me, because my car's socket is really hard to pull adaptors out of when they sit flush. I like how the USB ports light up, especially since the blue lights match my car's dashboard lights. It does seem to actually charge my iPhone 5S faster than my old Belkin car charger.",5
B087LV1KZ1,R2P2XRHUBHFIFV,"Great Value, Great Cords","First of all, for those who keep making this comment: they lied, not a fast charger, this is a rip off, etc. My original Samsung cord, purchased from Samsung which was a super rapid charger one day, then took 4 hours the next. Granted I had it for more than a year, and it charged the phone a million times, but this is not the fault of the vendor. Sometimes they just don't work, and you just exchange for a new one, and sometimes they just die, the wires are super fragile. They are made out of black box material, that everyone seems to think they should be.

About this cord, normally, long cords do not work well for rapid charging, as the current has so far to travel, and the cords get kinked easier or bent, tangled. These cords do not tangle, and both set works beautifully. They charge my phone in one hour, as opposed to 4. If they do wear out, I am not going to be one of those whiny people and just get another set. The price cannot be beat. This is by far the best cord/charger I have purchased, even better than one I bought from the Samsung website for 3 times the price. You will be satisfied with this vendor and this cord. Two tips for you, never buy just the cord, or just the charger, always buy a rapid charger set (cord/adaptor) for best connection.

Another tip for any type of charging cord. Take the little wire spring out of a ball point pen, and put on your charging cord near the end where they bend, from being in pocket or purse or in and out of your car. This causes that additional wear and tear where the wire become frayed, and sometimes come apart. The spring will keep the cord from bending, and I think it's a stellar solution, as I've never once had a cord fray or sever. It really chaps my behind when people pay so little, and write reviews like the purchase caused the buyer to lose their home. So much drama; calm down, and just get a replacement. Will buy this cord, from this vendor again. Best cord purchase to date.",5

B07VG9JMG1,R2C68FH1BZK5OR,Fast wireless charging!,"Awesome product, considering the 25W charger that comes with it, the price is not way too much. Wireless charging speed is on par with the previous 15W wired charging like S8. The phone does get warm during charging, but not hot.",5

B09L824FJL,R3S5NE0CNWPNJT,MY CELLPHONE OVERHEATS,"Whenever I use this cellphone charger, after about 20 minutes I get a message on my cellphone stating that my phone is overheating. This has happened multiple times. Tried returning it, but have been informed that it is over the return by date!! The main reason I bought this new cellphone charger was because it was fast charger. This overheating issue never happened with my old charger.",1
B07WYCJLS7,RO6Y3W93ZRSGY,"Quickcharges wirelessly, better than my previous Qi charger","I've had Qi charging in the past and it wasn't consistent at all. Sometimes I'd put my phone down and it would charge and other times it would not, this device works everytime without worry. I do need to center my phone on the pad but it works through my TPU case, it can even charge my phone with a thin piece of glass inbetween (I have a glass desk) though you need to be a lot more precise with the phones placement. All in all its a great charger for the price, I'm sure it will help me extend the life of my usb-c port. My only complaint is that the charger doesnt come with a wall plug and still utilizes micro usb type b.",4
B06XXZK99F,R275G2MVO4HYDX,Good stand,"Like this stand, but it could be better. First off it requires a Samsung (type C) cord. Yes it comes with one, but it's a little short. I had to order a 6ft cord. A longer cord would help and I have an iPhone so I had to order a cord.
Second is the angle, it's fixed. Adjustable would make this a great charging stand. Folding flat would make it more portable and less angle if you want it closer. Other than these two items it's a great stand.",4
